## Code of Conduct

This project operates under a code of conduct.
Participating in the project in any way (issues, pull requests, gitter, or other media) indicates that you agree that you will follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Description
<!-- usage note: edit this section. -->

With the rapidly evolving global situation related to COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need to centralize scientific knowledge relevant to the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.
This repository is an online, collaborative review paper written with [manubot](https://manubot.org/).
We are seeking input from scientists at all levels anywhere in the world.

Our goal is to quickly and accurately summarize and synthesize the papers that are coming out in order to develop a broader picture of what's being attempted and the status of those efforts.
We hope to contextualize elements of this virus and infectious disease with respect to better understood viruses and diseases (e.g., to identify shared mechanisms).
This repository is also a living document that aims to consolidate and integrate helpful information about diagnostics and therapeutics that is circulating in decentralized spaces (e.g., Twitter threads) into a more permanent and unified format.

## Contributions

You'll need to make a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

Instructions and procedures for contributing are [outlined here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We will follow the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for determining authorship.

Please note that, while reading scientific literature is a particular skill, we know that people outside of science are also invested in this topic and there is a lot of information circulating about the virus and about possible therapies.
Non-scientists are welcome to contribute by opening New Paper issues to let us know about topics or papers they're concerned about or would like to see addressed.

Undergraduate students who are interested are encouraged to take part in discussions, ask questions, post interesting papers, and contribute paper summaries (just please note in your summary that you're a student).

## Pull Requests

If you are not familiar with git and GitHub, you can use [these directions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) to start contributing.

Please feel encouraged to ask questions by opening a [Request for Help issue](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/issues/new?assignees=rando2&labels=&template=request-for-help.md&title=Help%3A+%5BAdd+topic+here%5D)
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/greenelab/covid19-review?label=Open%20Issue&style=social)](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/issues/new/choose)

This project is a collaborative effort that will benefit from the expertise of scientists across a wide range of disciplines!

## Manubot
<!-- usage note: do not edit this section -->

Manubot is a system for writing scholarly manuscripts via GitHub.
Manubot automates citations and references, versions manuscripts using git, and enables collaborative writing via GitHub.
An [overview manuscript](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/ "Open collaborative writing with Manubot") presents the benefits of collaborative writing with Manubot and its unique features.
The [rootstock repository](https://git.io/fhQH1) is a general purpose template for creating new Manubot instances, as detailed in [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).
See [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) for documentation how to write a manuscript.

Please open [an issue](https://git.io/fhQHM) for questions related to Manubot usage, bug reports, or general inquiries.
