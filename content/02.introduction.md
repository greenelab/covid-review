## Introduction {.page_break_before} 

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
By WHO Situation Report 61, released on March 20, 2020, 266,073 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with cases on every continent except Antarctica [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200321-sitrep-61-covid-19.pdf].
At this time, over 11,000 deaths had been reported worldwide.

[Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.]

COVID-19 is caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, a family of RNA viruses known to cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans and other species.
Infectious diseases of global concern have previously been associated with coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9]; however, neither of these reached pandemic status, owing to proper containment procedures (SARS) or intrinsic limitations in virus transmission (MERS).
Additionally, there are four endemic human coronaviruses that rarely progress beyond the mild symptoms associated with the common cold [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The precise identity of SARS-CoV-2 virus was unknown until approximately January 12, 2020, when Chinese officials released its genetic sequence to aid in worldwide efforts to diagnose the disease [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
As researchers worldwide work to characterize SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, information about the transmission and life cycle of the virus as well as the diagnosis and treatment of the disease is emerging rapidly.
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.

### About Coronaviruses

#### Classification:
Coronaviridae, commonly called Coronavirus, is a family of positive-sense RNA viruses [@isbn:0781760607]. 
Members of this family include the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which are two species, as well as SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae#Taxonomy].

#### Virion, morphology, structure:
Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging between 100 to 160nm. 
The virion has a lipid envelope with spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface creating a distinctive "crown" shape, for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:0781760607]. 

#### Genome structure and replication:
Coronavirus genomes are single-stranded non-segmented positive RNA (ssRNA+) that are 27 to 32kb in length. 
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp in length [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Coronavirus genomes are comprised of a replicase gene that is 2/3 of the genome and the remaining 1/3 that encodes structural proteins including: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 
There are additional accessory genes that are present depending on the strain. 
The non-structural polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except Gammacoronaviruses that do not contain nsp1), which form replication machinery to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681]. 

Replication initiates with the binding of the virus to a host cell via the S protein. 
The viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm. 
The replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
The dsRNA genome is then transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].  

#### Transmission:
In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes). 
While there does not appear to be experimental evidence to conclude which mode of transmission different coronaviruses use [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], it is suggested that the coronavirus person-to-person transmission is droplet-based using simulations [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032867] and trace studies[@doi:10.3390/ijerph15122757].

### Origin of SARS-CoV-2 
[MERS and SARS? Where to put this?]
[Specifically about SARS-CoV-2/COVID19?]
The origin of the SARS-CoV-19 virus is not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-19 is unlikely to have originated from a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-19 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-19 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts, however current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### Disease (COVID19)

#### Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important]

#### Symptoms

*Presentation of COVID-19:* 
Information is rapidly becoming available about the wide range of symptoms that can be associated with COVID-19 as well as the range of symptom severity, onset from exposure, and possible risk or protective factors...

In a retrospective sample of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan observed during December 2019 and January 2020, [@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, as well as high levels of d-dimer. 
Mortality also appeared to be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
They also found that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.


#### Vaccines for Viruses: Strategies for and challenges to development

What information is needed to develop a vaccine? How have vaccines for other viruses such as H1N1 been developed?

#### Diagnostics and Therapeutics for Viruses

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.

Within therapeutics, some possible efforts include efforts to identify strategies for the management of symptoms as well as the development of antivirals...

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
