## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 
Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.

#### Relevant Mechanisms and Possible Pharmaceutical Interventions
[Given what we know about the mechanisms of the virus and why it produces the symptoms we see, are there drugs or categories of intervention that might be relevant?]

#### Data-Driven Prediction of Interventions
[The machine learning community has been called upon to try to predict possible interventions. What are they doing and what are they finding about treating symptoms?]

### Antivirals
Antivirals are an emerging category of drugs.
Unlike antibiotics, they do not kill viruses.
Rather, they inhibit the proliferation of a virus.
Antivirals have been used to treat XYZ diseases through [what mechanisms or approaches are used?]

#### Antivirals and Coronoviruses
[Have antivirals been used to treat other coronaviruses? What went well/badly? How do these interventions work?]

Neutralizing Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies targeting viral antigens have shown therapeutic efficacy against viruses like Ebola and SARS CoV [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755][@doi:10.1126/science.aad5224].
The first human neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins has been developed [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958].

#### Antiviral Targeting of SARS-CoV-2
[What efforts are underway to develop antivirals for SARS-CoV-2? Is anything expected to be particularly challenging about this virus?]
[What are possible ways to target SARS-CoV-2 that are being proposed, developed, or tested?]

#### Data-Driven Analysis and Identification of Antivirals
[Can we predict possible strategies for antiviral development based on available literature? How are people approaching this and what are they finding?]

### Vaccines
Vaccines, widely recognized as one of the most significant advances in human health during the 20th century, can be used to bolser both individual and herd immunity to a virus by promoting the development of antibodies without infection.
[Are vaccines available for other coronaviruses or related viral illnesses?]

#### Strategies and Challenges to Vaccine Development
[What are some of the challenges to developing a vaccine? What needs to be taken into account about how the virus works?]
[Are there any challenges or opportunities unique to coronaviruses and/or SARS-CoV-2?]
[What are some approaches being tested or considered?]

#### Big Data and Vaccines
[Has the AI community contributed to vaccine development in the past? Are there particular challenges or opportunities here? What are people working on and/or finding?]
