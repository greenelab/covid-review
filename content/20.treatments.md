## Therapeutics

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual‚Äôs immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b].
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms

The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection differs dramatically between individuals.
Some are asymptomatic.
Others experience mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and fever, while the most severe cases of COVID-19 include severe complications including pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure and death [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html].
Vaccines are one avenue to mitigate harm from viral pathogens, but in the case of a rapidly growing pandemic the longer timeframe of vaccine development and distribution means that there can be a key for treatments that palliate symptoms to avoid the most severe outcomes from infection.

#### Tocilizumab

A recent study carried out on a sample of 191 adult COVID-19 in-patients at two Wuhan hospitals found that blood samples taken at admission contained significantly higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients who ultimately deceased compared to those who survived; average concentrations of IL-6 remained higher in the deceased group than the surviving group throughout hospitalization [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
This suggests that these individuals may be experiencing a "cytokine storm", which refers to an excessive inflammatory response.
IL-6 plays a key role in this response [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of interleukins, which are immune system regulators that are primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation.
Specifically, IL-6 promotes the differentiation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells [@pmid:9052836] and acts as a growth factor for hybridoma and myeloma cells [@pmid:8431556; @pmid:2104241].
In addition, IL-6 also induces the differentiation of na√Øve CD4+ T cells into effector T-cell subsets [@doi:10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0022].
In this way interleukins regulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.
In this context, the observation of elevated IL-6 in patients who died may reflect an over-production of proinflammatory interleukins.

In a healthy situation the lung respiratory epithelium together with alveolar macrophages limits the activation of the immune system, ensuring homeostasis.
The introduction of the S-protein from SARS-CoV to mouse macrophages was found to increase production of IL-6 and TNF-Œ± [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.007], and deceased SARS-CoV patients were found to have intermediate levels of IL-6, IL-1ùõΩ, and TNF-Œ± expressed in a number of ACE2-expressing cell types sampled from the lung and bronchial tissues during autopsy [@doi:10.1002/path.2067].
However, other reports found the severe respiratory condition ARDS to be associated with elevated concentrations of IL-6 in BALF, but that concentrations of Tumor Necrosis Factor Œ± (TNF-Œ±) and IL-1ùõΩ decreased with the onset of ARDS [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
These cytokines enhance the pro-inflammatory reaction by increase acute-phase signaling, trafficking of immune cells to the site of primary infection, epithelial cell activation, and secondary cytokine production.
The acute phase response to infection results in the heavily damage of the endotelium of blood vessels, which disrupts the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory response [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
Thus, the holes generated allow not just for the passage of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection but also the accumulation of liquids into the lungs, which is the ultimate cause of the death as per Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome (ADRS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [@doi:10.1007/s00281-017-0629-x], also caused by the new coronavirus.
Recently Chinese and Italian doctors have found that the the Tocilizumab (actemra, by Roche), a drug commonly used in the rheumatoid arthritis, may palliate the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19.

##### Anticipated Mechanism

Human IL-6 is a glycoprotein of 26 kDa and it consists of 184 amino acids containing 2 potential N-glycosylation sites and four cysteine residues. IL-6 binds to its receptor either in the insoluble (IL-6R) and soluble (sIL-6R) form.
The receptor specificity determines the type of signaling. Specifically, the binding of IL-6 to the cell membrane receptor IL-6R gives rise to the "classical transduction of the signaling", while to binding to sIL-6R generate the so called "trans-signaling" [@doi:10.1016/j.cytogfr.2012.04.001; @doi:10.1042/bj3000281].
IL-6 signaling occurs through 3 independent pathways: the Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-STAT3 pathway, the Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathway and the Phosphoinositol-3 Kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
The ultimate result of the IL-6 cascade is to direct transcriptional activity of various promoters of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TFN, including IL-6 own regulation through the activity of NF-Œ∫B [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2016.00604].
Particularly, IL-6 synthesis is tightly regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally . In this context, it has been shown that viral proteins can enhance transcription of the IL-6 gene, via strengthening the DNA-binding activity between several transciptional factors and IL-6 gene-cis-regulatory elements [@doi:10.2492/inflammregen.33.054].
Tocilizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds both to the insoluble and soluble receptor of IL-6, de facto inhibiting the IL-6 immune cascade.

##### Current Evidence

Chinese doctors have started a trial enrolling 188 patients of which 14 with severe lung disease have shown clear sings of improvements, according to their results [@url:https://www.genengnews.com/virology/coronavirus/genentech-launches-phase-iii-trial-of-actemra-as-coronavirus-treatment/].
Also, The AIFA (the Italian Drug Agency) approved the start of a new trial on March 19 recruiting patients at the initial stage of the infection [@url:https://www.univadis.co.uk/viewarticle/covid-19-italy-launches-an-independent-trial-on-tocilizumab-715741].
Together with these independent trials, Roche, also in collaboration with the FDA, will start a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial early April.
The trial will enroll 330 patients globally, which will be followed for 60 days upon use of the drug via injection to analyse its efficiency/safety (Biopharma-reporter.com).
However, previous studies on RA showed that in patients treated with TCZ the rate of incident infections in clinical practice patients was higher than the one observed during clinical trial [@doi:10.1093/rheumatology/ker223].
Also, RA patients with chronic hepatitis B (HB) infection showed high risk of HB virus reactivation upon TCZ administration in combination with other RA drugs [@doi:10.1111/1756-185X.13010].
These last findings highlight the need to search for a balance between impairing a harmful immune response, such as the one generated by the cytokine storm, and preventing the worsening of the clinical picture of the patients by potential new viral infections.
This aspect is probably crucial to be investigated further in the trials that are about to start.
Perhaps, the TCZ treatment would best suit patients with severely compromised lungs due to the Covid-19 infection and are therefore at greater risk of death, in order to stop the uncontrolled immune response before it‚Äôs too late.

### Small Molecule Drugs for Targeting SARS-CoV-2

The replication cycle of a virus within an epithelial host cell includes 6 basic steps which can be shortly summarised as follow: i) attachment of the virus to the host cell; ii) penetration by endocytosis; iii) uncoating, classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell; iv) biosynthesis, during which the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated; v) assembly, where viral proteins are translated and new viral particles are assembled; vi) release, when the new viruses are released into the extracellular environment [@isbn:978-1405136457].
Antiviral drugs do not kill the virus, rather they inhibit its amplification by impairing one of these steps.
Nowadays, many of these drugs act during the biosynthesis step in order to inhibit the virus‚Äô genetic material replication.
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.
Differently from a DNA virus, which can use the host enzymes to propagate itself, RNA viruses depends on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in order to be replicated [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].

#### Nucleotide Analogs

Why one might use nucleotide analogs.

##### Avigan

Avigan (Flavipiravir, from Toyama chemical Fujifilm) is a drug which has been found effective to block viral amplification in the Influenza virus infection.

###### Anticipated Mechanism

Specifically, Avigan is a nucleoside precursor efficiently recognised as guanosine and adenosine analogue by the virus polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).
While a single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
Importantly It was already shown that Avigan is able to give 100% coverage against the Ebola virus in mice [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.02.014].
Furthermore, there are evidences that drug might also work against Corona virus infection.
For instance, a recent study showed its effectiveness compared to other antivirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007].
The drug was tested on a sample of 80 patients (35 experimental sample, 45 control group) and increased the speed of recovery (measured as viral clearance from the patient by RT-PCR) of about 4 days, compared to the control sample treated with the other anti-virals, such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir.
Also lung body scan seem to look better in about 91% of the patients analysed [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007].
However, the size of the sample is too small to give a powerful statistics, as well as the choice of the patients did not take into consideration important factors such as previous clinical conditions, sex, while there was no age categorisation.

##### Remdesivir

Remdesivir (GS-5734) was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola.
It does not have any FDA-approved use.
Although a clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo found some evidence of effectiveness against ebola, two antibody preparations were found to be more effective, and Remdesivir was not pursued [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1910993].

###### Anticipated Mechanism

Remdesivir is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair causing chain termination [@doi:10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00221-18; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Although it was developed against Ebola, it also inhibits the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV polymerase and inhibits coronavirus replication in cell culture assays with submicromolar IC50s [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653].
It also inhibits SARS-CoV-2, showing synergy with chloroquine _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

###### Current Evidence

In addition to the previous work showing Remdesivir to be an effective treatment for viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cultured cells and animal models, a recent study found that administration of Remdesivir to non-human primate models resulted in 100% protection against infection by the Ebola virus.
Remdesivir has also been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human cell line sensitive to the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].

The effectiveness of Remdesivir for treating patients with COVID-19 is currently under investigation.
Remdesivir has been used on some COVID-19 patients under compassionate use guidelines [@doi:10.1126/science.abb7243, @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2001191; @doi:10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896].
All were in late stages of COVID-19 infection, and these reports are inconclusive about the drug's efficacy.
Gilead Sciences, the maker of Remdesivir, led a recent publication that reported outcomes for compassionate use of the drug in 61 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19.
Here, 200mg of Remdesivir was administered intravenously on day 1, followed by a further 100mg/day for 9 days [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016].
There were significant issues with the study design or lack thereof.
There was no randomized control group.
The inclusion criteria were variable: some patients only required low doses of oxygen, others required ventilation.
The study included many sites, potentially with variable inclusion criteria and treatment protocols.
Patients analyzed had mixed demographics.
There was a short follow-up period of investigation.
Some patients worsened, some patients died, and eight were excluded from the analysis mainly due to missing post-baseline information, thus their health is unaccounted for.
Therefore, even though the study reported clinical improvement in 68% of the 53 patients ultimately evaluated, due to the significant issues with study design, it cannot be determined whether treatment with Remdesivir had an effect or whether these patients would have recovered regardless of treatment.
As a result, the study does not alter our understanding of the efficacy of Remdesivir in this setting, and randomized controlled trials are still required.
Remdesivir recently entered controlled clinical trials, and as of March 2020, there are six clinical trials underway to treat COVID-19 patients at both early and late stages of infection and in combinations with other drugs [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705; @url:https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-000936-23/FR; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252664; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04257656].

###### Summary

Remdesivir is a major drug candidate since it attacks the virus with high potency and known mechanism.
Moreover, one of the most successful therapies for viral diseases is to target the viral replication machinery, which are typically virally encoded polymerases.
Small molecule drugs targeting viral polymerases are the backbones of treatments for other viral diseases including HIV and Herpes.
Note that the HIV and Herpes polymerases are a reverse transcriptase and a DNA polymerase respectively, whereas SARS-CoV-2 encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, so most of the commonly used polymerase inhibitors are not likely to be active against SARS-CoV-2.
In clinical use, polymerase inhibitors show short term benefits for HIV patients but for long term benefits they must be part of combination regimens.
They are typically combined with protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and even other polymerase inhibitors.

### Broad-Spectrum Pharmaceuticals

##### Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are quinolones that have been widely used as anti-malarial and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in humans.
HCQ and CQ act through the same mechanism of action, but HCQ is regarded to be safer [@doi:10.1136/ard.2008.101766].
HCQ/CQ have been reported to have anti-viral effects, including in HIV-1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10/dh8phb; @doi:10.1128/AAC.03011-14; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
_In vitro_ studies of CQ use for SARs-CoV infection suggest anti-viral activity is due to inhibition of viral entry through elevation of endosomal pH and terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the cellular entry receptor [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-2-69].
In vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection show both HCQ and CQ to be effective in inhibiting viral replication, with HCQ being more potent [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237].
A case study of three COVID-19 patients reported presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in all three patients  [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2007575]. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies are central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
HCQ has been reported to be effective in treating Antiphospholipid Syndrome [@doi:10.1182/blood.V128.22.5023.5023; @doi:10.1016/j.autrev.2014.01.053; @doi:10.1182/asheducation-2016.1.714].

Thus, there is excitement about HCQ as a potential therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
This section will discuss current efforts on assessing the potential impact of HCQ in treating COVID-19.

###### Current Evidence

Gautret et al conducted a non-randomized, non-blinded, non-placebo clinical trial on 42 hospitalized patients comparing HCQ to standard care [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949].
This trial found patients who received HCQ showed higher rates of virological clearance by nasopharyngeal swab on Days 3-6 when compared to standard care.
This study also treated six patients with both HCQ + azithromycin and found this combination therapy to be more effective than HCQ alone.
This study showed design and analysis weaknesses that severely limit interpretability of results.
These weaknesses include: lack of randomization, lack of blinding, lack of placebo, lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis, lack of correction for sequential multiple comparisons, trial arms entirely confounded by hospital, false negatives in outcome measurements, lack of trial pre-registration, and small sample size.
Two of these weaknesses are due to inappropriate data analysis and can therefore be corrected post-hoc by recalculating p-values (lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis and multiple comparisons.)
However, all other weaknesses are fundamental design flaws and can not be corrected for.
Thus, conclusions cannot be generalized outside of the study.
Additionally, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the scientific organization that publishes _International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents_ where the article appeared, has announced that the article does not meet its expected standard for publications [@url:https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement], although it has not been officially retracted.
Because of the preliminary data presented in this study, the use of HCQ in COVID-19 treatment has subsequently been explored by other researchers.

A randomized, non-placebo trial of 62 COVID-19 patients at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University studied whether HCQ decreased time to fever break or time to cough relief when compared to standard care [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758].
This trial found HCQ decreased both average time to fever break and average time to cough relief, defined as mild or no cough.
However, this study also had flaws in trial design and analysis that prevent generalization of the results.
These weaknesses include: lack of placebo, lack of correction for multiple primary outcomes, inappropriate choice of outcomes, lack of sufficient detail to understand analysis, drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol, and small sample size.
The choice of outcomes may be inappropriate as both fevers and cough may break periodically without resolution of illness.
Additionally, for these outcomes, the authors report 23/62 patients did not have fever and 25/62 patients did not have cough at the start of the study - the authors fail to describe how these patients were included in a study assessing time to fever break and time to cough relief.
It is important to note here that the authors claim "neither the research performers nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments."
This seems impossible in a non-placebo trial - at the very least, providers would know whether they were administering a medication or not, and this knowledge could lead to systematic differences in how care is given.
Correction for multiple primary outcomes can be adjusted post-hoc by recalculating p-values, but all other issues are design and statistical weaknesses that cannot be corrected for.
Additionally, the observation of drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol may be suggestive of p-hacking.
Conclusions cannot de generalized outside of the study, but the results support further investigation.

A randomized trial from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center of 30 COVID-19 patients studied whether HCQ increased rates of virological clearance by respiratory pharyngeal swab on Day 7 post-treatment compared to standard care [@doi:10/drbx].
This trial was published in Chinese with an abstract also in English.
Only the English abstract was read and interpreted.
The trial found HCQ showed comparable outcomes to standard care with regard to virological clearance rate, time to virological clearance, and time to body temperature normalization.
A known weakness is small sample size.
This problem suggests the study is underpowered to detect potentially useful differences and precludes interpretation of results.
Additionally, because only the abstract could be read, other design and analysis issues could be present.
Conclusions should be interpreted very cautiously.
However, these preliminary negative results do reiterate the need for further study.

A case study treated 11 consecutive patients with HCQ + azithromycin using the same dosing regime reported by Gautret et al [@doi:10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.006].
One patient died, two were transferred to the ICU, and one developed a prolonged QT interval leading to discontinuation of HCQ + azithromycin.
As in the Gautret et al study, the outcome measurement was virological clearance at Day 6 post-treatment by nasopharyngeal swabs.
Of the ten living patients on Day 6, eight of the patients remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Interpretation of conclusions are severely limited by lack of comparison group and small sample size.
However, these results stand in contrast to claims by Gautret et al that all six patients treated with HCQ + azithromycin tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Day 6 post-treatment.
This case study illustrates the need for better and further investigation.

A Letter to the Editor was published in BioScience Trends claiming numerous clinical trials showed HCQ is superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of COVID-19 pneumonia [@doi:10.5582/bst.2020.01047].
This Letter has been cited by numerous primary literature, review articles, and media alike [@doi:10.7150/ijbs.45498; @doi:10.7150/ijbs.45053].
Yet, this Letter's claims of clinical trials supporting HCQ use refer only to 15 pre-registration identifiers from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.
When these identifiers are followed back to the registry, most trials claim they are not yet recruiting patients or are currently recruiting patients.
For all of these 15 identifiers, no data uploads or links to publications could be located on the pre-registrations.
At the very least, an inability to locate primary data means such claims cannot be verified.
Additionally, citation of unavailable sources cast doubt on policies and research based on the assumption that HCQ is effective in treating COVID-19.


###### Summary

In vitro evidence shows HCQ may be an effective therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 
Multiple clinical studies have already been carried out to assess this possibility.
All current studies are low-quality and have small sample sizes.
Thus, interpretation is severely limited and must be done cautiously.
Additionally, disagreements between studies demonstrate there is controversy on the effectiveness of HCQ, as well as HCQ + azithromycin combination therapy.

-->
This uncertainty is important to recognize clinically because HCQ-based treatments can lead to dangerous side effects like prolonged QT interval [@doi:10.1155/2016/4626279].
HCQ use for COVID-19 also leads to shortages for anti-malarial or anti-rheumatic use, where it has been definitively proven to be effective.
Further investigation of HCQ in large, rigorous, multi-center clinical trials is necessary.

#### Nutraceuticals

Considering the current pandemic, scientists and the medical community are scrambling to repurpose or discover novel host-directed therapies for which nutraceuticals hold some promise.
Nutraceuticals are classified as supplements with health benefits beyond their basic nutritional value designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of disease [@doi:10.1080/10408390902841529; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Nutraceuticals purported to boost the immune response, reduce  immunopathology, exhibit antiviral activities or prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are being considered for their potential therapeutic value [@doi:10/ggkd3b].
A host of potential candidates have been highlighted in the literature that target various aspects of the COVID-19 viral pathology, while others are thought to prime the host immune system.
These candidates include vitamins and minerals along with extracts and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707].
Considerable evidence in vitro and in vivo suggests that nutraceuticals containing phycocyanobilin, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, selenium or phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals (e.g. ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane) can prevent or modulate RNA virus infections via amplification of the signaling activity of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and activation of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007]. 
While promising, further animal and human studies are required to assess the therapeutic potential of these various nutraceuticals against COVID-19. 

##### n-3 PUFA

Another potential nutraceutical that has exhibited beneficial effects against various viral infections is n-3 PUFA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
EPA and DHA intake can come from a diet high in fish intake or through dietary supplementation with fish oils or purified oils [@doi:10.3390/molecules22111964].


###### Potential Mechanisms

N-3 PUFA nutraceuticals can mediate inflammation and they have the capacity to modulate the adaptive immune response [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04374.x; @doi:10.3390/molecules22111964; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Another potential mechanism by which n-3 PUFA could exert beneficial effects against viral infections is by acting as precursor molecules for the biosynthesis of endogenous specialised proresolving mediators (SPM) like protectins and resolvins that actively resolve inflammation and infection [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.02.009]. 

###### Current Evidence

SPM have exhibited beneficial effects against a variety of lung infections including RNA viruses [@doi:10.1038/nri.2015.4].
Indeed, protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
Moreover, not all studies are in agreement that n-3 PUFA are effective against infections [@doi:10.3945/jn.109.108027]. 
Indeed, the effectiveness of n-3 PUFA against infections is dependent on the dosage, timing, and the specific pathogens responsible [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2016.10.001].  

###### Summary

However, the overall lack of human studies in this area means there is limited evidence as to whether these nutraceuticals could affect COVID-19 infection.  

##### Zinc Supplements

There is evidence that nutrient supplements may exhibit some benefit against RNA viral infections.
Zinc is a trace metal obtained from dietary sources or supplementation that is important for the maintenance of immune cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc supplements can be administered orally as a tablet or as a lozenge and they are available in many forms such zinc picolinate, zinc acetate, and zinc citrate.
Zinc is also available from dietary sources including meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes, and dairy.

###### Potential Mechanisms

The role of zinc in immune function has been extensively reviewed [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Zinc is an important signaling molecule and zinc levels can alter host defense systems. 
In inflammatory situations such as an infection, zinc can regulate leukocyte immune responses and it can activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), thus altering cytokine production [@doi:10.4049/jimmunol.179.6.4180; @doi:10.1067/mlc.2001.118108]. 
In particular, zinc supplementation can increase natural killer cell levels, which are important cells for host defense against viral infections [@doi:10.1126/science.1198687; @doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].

###### Current Evidence

Adequate zinc intake has been associated with reduced incidence of infection [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837] and antiviral immunity [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmz013].
Similarly, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that administered zinc supplementation to elderly subjects over the course of a year found zinc deficiency to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and that zinc deficiency could be prevented through supplementation [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837].
Clinical trial data supports the utility of zinc to diminish the duration and severity of symptoms associated with common colds when it is provided within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz; @doi:10.2174/1874306401105010051].
In coronaviruses specifically, in vitro evidence demonstrates that the combination of zinc (Zn2+) and zinc ionophores (pyrithione) can interrupt the replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-GFP (a flourescently tagged SARS-CoV) and a variety of other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015].

###### Summary

While overall there is encouraging data for zinc supplementation against the common cold and viral infections, there is currently limited evidence to suggest zinc supplementation has any beneficial effects against the current novel COVID-19, thus further research is imperative.
However, it would be advisable to maintain a healthy diet to ensure an adequate zinc status to prevent the likelihood of an infection. 

##### Vitamin C

Vitamins B, C, D, and E have also been suggested as potential nutrient supplement interventions for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707; @doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0347.v1].
In particular vitamin C has been proposed as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against COVID-19. 
Vitamin C can be obtained via dietary sources such as fruit and vegetable or via supplementation.  

###### Potential Mechanisms
Vitamin C plays a signifiant role in promoting immune function due to its effects on various immune cells. 
Vitamin C affects inflammation by modulating cytokine production, decreasing histamine levels, enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, increasing antibody levels, and protecting against the negative effects of reactive oxygen species amongst other effects [@doi:10.1155/2014/426740; @doi:10.1007/s00210-013-0880-1; @doi:10.3390/nu9111211]. 
During viral infections vitamin C is utilised as evinced by lower concentrations in leukocytes and lower concentrations of urinary vitamin C. 
Post-infection, these levels return to baseline ranges [@doi:10.1177/003693307301800102; @doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29312.x; @doi:10/fd22sv; @doi:10.3390/nu9040339; @doi:10.1079/bjn19920004]. 

###### Current Evidence

A recent meta-analysis found consistent support for regular vitamin C supplementation reducing the duration of the common cold, but that supplementation with vitamin C (> 200 mg) failed to reduce the incidence of colds [@doi:10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4].
Individual studies have found Vitamin C to reduce the susceptibility of patients to lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia [@doi:10.1097/00006454-199709000-00003].
A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated in twelve trials that vitamin C supplementation reduced the length of stay of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) by 7.8% (95% CI: 4.2% to 11.2%; p = 0.00003).
Furthermore, high doses (1-3 g/day) significantly reduced the length of an ICU stay by 8.6% in six trials (p = 0.003).
Vitamin C also shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% in three trials in which patients required intervention for over 24 hours (95% CI 7.7% to 27%; p = 0.001)  [@doi:10.3390/nu11040708]. 
Despite these findings, the CITRUS ALI study failed to show a benefit of a 96-hour infusion of vitamin C to treat ARDS, which is a severe complication of COVID-19 infection [@doi:10.1001/jama.2019.11825].

###### Summary

The evidence suggests that vitamin C supplementation can shorten the duration of a cold, reduce an individual's susceptibility to infections, and shorten a patient's stay in ICU when administered at high doses.
While there is anecdotal evidence from China and the United States that vitamin C is currently being used for the treatment of COVID-19,  further controlled research is required.

##### Vitamin D

In terms of other dietary supplements, vitamin D can modulate the adaptive and innate immune system and has been associated with various aspects of health. 
Vitamin D can be sourced through diet or supplementation, but it is mainly biosyntheised by the body on exposure to sunlight.

###### Potential Mechanisms

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755].
In particular, vitamin D deficient patients are at risk of developing acute respiratory infections [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017] and ARDS [@doi:10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017]. 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the active form of vitamin D that is involved in adaptive and innate resopnses, whereby the vitamin D receptor is expressed in various immunne cells and vitamin D is an immunomodulator of antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and T- and B-lymphocytes [@doi:10.2310/JIM.0b013e31821b8755; @doi:10.1016/j.coph.2010.04.001].
Due to its potential immunomodulating properties, vitamin D supplementation may be advantageous to maintain a healthy immune system. 

###### Current Evidence

A recent preprint postulated that an individual‚Äôs vitamin D status may significantly affect one‚Äôs risk of developing COVID-19. 
This hypothesis was derived from the fact that the current pandemic occurred in winter in Wuhan China when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are at their lowest due to lack of sunlight, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, where it was nearing the end of the summer, the number of cases was low at that time coinciding with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [@doi:10.20944/preprints202003.0235.v2].
The authors suggest that people at risk of developing COVID-19 should increase their vitamin D3 intake to reach 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma concentrations above 40‚Äì60 ng/ml.
The authors also suggest supplementation of vitamin D to treat infected patients and to prevent infection in hospital staff.
While vitamin D is relatively inexpensive and safe to consume, caution is warranted when interpreting this review as it has yet to be determined whether vitamin D levels effect COVID-19 specifically. 
Likewise, it is assumed that COVID-19 may be seasonal, but there are multiple other factors at play that can affect vitamin D levels that need to be considered.
These factors include an individual‚Äôs nutritional status, their age, their occupation, skin pigmentation, potential comorbidities, and the variation of exposure to sunlight due to latitude amongst others [@doi:10.3390/nu7075111].   

###### Summary
  
Supplementation of vitamin D and maintaining a healthy diet for optimum vitamin D status warrants further investigation. 
This is particularly important considering ‚Äòstay in place‚Äô guidance has been implemented in many densely populated cities around the world.
This measure is likely to limit people‚Äôs exposure to sunlight and thus reduce endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, potentially weakening the immune system and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. 

##### Nutraceutical Conclusions

Despite all the potential benefits of nutraceutical and dietary supplement interventions presented, currently there is a paucity of clinical evidence to support their use for the prevention or mitigation of COVID-19 infections. 
Nevertheless, optimal nutritional status will undoubtedly prime an individual‚Äôs immune system to protect against the effects of acute respiratory viral infections by supporting normal maintenance of the immune system [@url:https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0199/v1].
Overall, supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may be an effective method of ensuring their adequate intake to maintain optimal immune function, which may also convey beneficial effects against viral infections due to their immunomodulatory effects.
However, many supplements and nutraceuticals designed for various ailments are available in the United States and beyond that are not strictly regulated [@doi:10.1080/10408398.2019.1592107]. 
Indeed, there can be safety and efficacy concerns associated with many of these products.
Often, the vulnerable memeber of society can be exploited in this regard and unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to several companies for advertising falsified claims in relation to the preventative and therapeutic capabilities of their products against COVID-19 [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-update-fda-and-ftc-warn-seven-companies-selling-fraudulent-products-claim-treat-or].  
In light of these serious occurrences, it is pertinent to clarify that the nutraceuticals discussed in this review have been selected because of their possible relevance to the biological mechanisms that can beneficially affect viral and respiratory infections.
Therefore, further intensive investigation is required to establish the effects of these nutraceticals, if any, against COVID-19.  

### Biological Drugs for COVID-19

#### Neutralizing Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases. 
As a result, they have become some of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to prevent viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry through receptor binding intereference [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.

##### Spike (S) Neutralizing Antibody

During the first SARS epidemic in 2002, nAbs were found in SARS-CoV infected patients [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.01009.x;@doi:10.1086/423286].
Several studies following up on these findings identified various S glycoprotein epitopes as the major targets of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
The passive transfer of immune serum containing nAbs from SARS-CoV-infected mice resulted in protection of na√Øve mice from viral lower respiratory tract infection upon intranasal challenge [@doi:10.1128/jvi.78.7.3572-3577.2004].
Similarly, a meta-analysis suggested that administration of plasma from recovered SARS-CoV patients reduced mortality upon SARS-CoV infection [@doi:10.1093/infdis/jiu396]. 

Similar results have been observed for MERS-CoV infections, which emerged as the second coronavirus-related epidemic.
Neutralizing antibodies have been identified against various epitopes of the RBD of the S glycoprotein [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1402074111; doi:10.1128/JVI.00912-14].

###### Spike (S) Neutralizing Antibody Anticipated Mechanisms

Coronaviruses use trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on their surface to bind to host cell receptors, such as ACE2, allowing for cell entry [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058].
Each S glycoprotein protomer is comprised of an S1 domain, also called the receptor binding domain (RBD), and an S2 domain.
The S1 domain binds to host cell receptors while the S2 domain facilitates the fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
Although targeting of the host cell receptor ACE2 shows efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection [@doi:10.1038/nature02145], given the physiological relevance of ACE2 [@doi:10/bsbp49], it would be favorable to target virus-specific structures rather than host receptors.
This forms the rationale of developing neutralizing antibodies against the S glycoprotein, disrupting its interaction with ACE2 and other receptors and thereby inhibiting viral entry.


###### Spike (S) Neutralizing Antibody Current Evidence

The first human neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins has been developed using hybridoma technology, [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958], where antibody-producing B-cells developed by mice can be inserted into myeloma cells to produce a hybrid cell line (the hybridoma) that is grown in culture.
The 47D11 clone was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 by a mechanism that is different from receptor binding interference.
The exact mechanism of how this clone neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and inhibits infection in vitro remains unknown, but a potential mechanism might be antibody induced destabilization of the membrane prefusion structure [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.028].
The ability of this antibody to prevent infection at a feasible dose needs to be validated in vivo, especially since in vitro neutralization effects have been shown to not be reflective of in vivo efficacy [@doi:10.1128/JVI.01603-17].
Only a week later, a different group successfully isolated multiple nAbs targeting the RBD of the S glycoprotein from blood samples taken from COVID-19 patients in China [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.21.990770].
Interestingly, the patient isolated antibodies did not cross-react with RBD‚Äôs from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although cross-reactivity to the trimeric spike proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was observed.
This suggests that the RBDs between the three coronavirus species are immunologically distinct and that the isolated nAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are species specific.
While this specificity is desirable, it also raises the question of whether these antibodies are more susceptible to viral escape mechanisms.
Viral escape is a common resistance mechanism to nAbs therapy due to selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies [@doi:10.2217/imt.15.33; @doi:10.1126/science.1213256].
For HIV, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) show greater neutralization breadth than monoclonal antibodies, which target only specific HIV strains [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2019.01.007].
For MERS-CoV, a combination of multiple neutralizing antibodies targeting different antigenic sites prevented neutralization escape [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02002-17].
It was found that the different antibody isolates did not target the same epitopes, suggesting that using them in combination might produce a synergistic effect that prevents viral escape [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.21.990770].
It was also demonstrated that binding affinity of the antibodies does not reflect their capability to compete with ACE2 binding.
Furthermore, no conclusions about correlations between the severity of disease and the ability to produce neutralizing antibodies can be drawn at this point.
Rather, higher neutralizing antibody titers were more frequently found in patients with severe disease.
Correspondingly, higher levels of anti-spike IgG were observed in patients that deceased from infection compared to patient that recovered [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.123158].

###### Spike (S) Neutralizing Antibody Summary 

Results from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics can provide valuable lessons for the design of neutralizing antibodies for the current outbreak.
The findings for SARS-CoV and MERS can aid in identifying which structures constitute suitable targets for nAbs, despite the fact that the RBD appears to be distinct between the three coronavirus species.
These studies also suggest that a combination of nAbs targeting distinct antigens might be necessary to provide protection [@doi:10.1128/JVI.02002-17].
The biggest challenge remains identifying antibodies that not only bind to their target, but also prove to be beneficial for disease management.
On that note, a recently published study indicates that anti-spike antibodies could make the disease worse rather than eliminating the virus [@doi:10.1172/jci.insight.123158].
These findings underscores our current lack of understanding the full immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

#### Interferons

Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines crucial to activate the first (innate) immune system response against viral infections.
Interferons are classified into three categories based on their receptor specificity: type I, II and III [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
Specifically, IFNs I (IFN-ùõº and ùõΩ) and II (IFN-ùõæ ) induce the expression of antiviral proteins which bring the viral RNA to degradation [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
Among these IFNs, IFN- ùõΩ was already found to strongly inhibit the replication of other corona viruses, such as SARS-Cov, in cell culture, while IFN-ùõº and ùõæ were shown to be less effective in this context [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013].
There are evidences that patients with higher susceptibility to develop Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) show indeed deficiency of IFN- ùõΩ.
For instance, upon other Corona viruses infection IFN- ùõΩ expression and synthesis is impaired, so that the virus can in fact escape the innate immune response [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024].

On March 18 2020 Synairgen plc has received approval to start a phase II trial for SNG001, an IFN- ùõΩ-1a formulation to be delivered to lungs via inhalation.
SNG001 was already shown to be effective reducing viral load in swine flu in vivo model, as well as it has been shown to be effective in the protection from other Corona virus infection in vitro (Synairgen plc, press release).

### Vaccines

Vaccines, widely recognized as one of the most significant advances in human health during the 20th century, can be used to bolser both individual and herd immunity to a virus by promoting the development of antibodies without infection.
[Are vaccines available for other coronaviruses or related viral illnesses?]
[What are some of the challenges to developing a vaccine? What needs to be taken into account about how the virus works?]
[Are there any challenges or opportunities unique to coronaviruses and/or SARS-CoV-2?]
[What are some approaches being tested or considered?]

#### DNA Vaccines

This vaccination method involves the direct introduction of a plasmid containing a DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought into appropriate tissues [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].

##### Anticipated Mechanism

This approach may offer several advantages over traditional vaccination approaches, such as the stimulation of both B- as well as T-cell responses and the absence of any infectious agent. 

##### Current Evidence

Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04336410]. 
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA¬Æ device to healthy volunteers. 
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner. 
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA¬Æ device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response. 

Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 6, 2020, the Phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO. 
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations. 
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA¬Æ 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4. 
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA¬Æ 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2020. 

##### Summary

The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult.

### Underexplored Therapeutics

The majority of current clinical trials and lines of investigation have focused on repurposing existing therapies to counter SARS-CoV-2 and treat its symptoms.
This is necessary given the urgency of the situation as well as the extensive time required for developing and testing new therapies.
However, in the long-term, new drugs specific for treatment of COVID-19 may also enter development.
There is thus value in investigating two lines of inquiry for treatment of COVID-19: 1) new therapeutics specific for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms, and 2) repurposing of existing therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms.
Here we consider further avenues that scientific investigators may explore in the development of therapies for COVID-19.

Given the great focus in investigating hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, it may be of interest to researchers to explore related alternatives.
For example, hydroxyferroquine derivatives of HCQ have been described as a class of bioorganometallic compounds that exert antiviral effects with some selectivity for SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1021/jm0601856].
Future work could explore whether these compounds exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether they are safe for use in animals and humans.

The tocilizumab trial described in an above section [@doi:10/ggnxb3] studies the possibility of using an anti-inflammatory agent typically used for the treatment of autoimmune disease to counter the effects of the ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù induced by the virus.
Another anti-IL-6 antibody, sarilumab, is also being investigated [@url:http://www.news.sanofi.us/2020-03-16-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-begin-global-Kevzara-R-sarilumab-clinical-trial-program-in-patients-with-severe-COVID-19; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04327388].
Typically, immunosuppressive drugs such as these are contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275].
However, COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, suggesting that immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
The decision of whether and/or when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 remains in debate as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity continue to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
If the need to curtail the ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù inflammatory response to the virus transcends the risks of immunosuppression, exploration of more anti-inflammatory agents may be warranted; these agents are considered here.
While tocilizumab targets IL-6, several other inflammatory markers could be potential targets, including TNF-alpha. Inhibition of TNF-alpha by an inhibitor such as Etanercept has been previously suggested for treatment of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1185/030079903125002757] and may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.
Baricitinib and other small molecule inhibitors of the JAK kinase pathway also curtail the inflammatory response and have been suggested as potential options for SARS-CoV-2 infections [@doi:10/dph5].
Baricitinib in particular may be able to reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect lung cells [@doi:10/ggnrsx].
Clinical trials studying baricitinib in COVID-19 have already begun in the US and in Italy [@url:https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-covid-19; @url:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04320277].
Identification and targeting of further inflammatory markers that are relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be of value for curtailing the inflammatory response and lung damage.
Lastly, it is also worth noting the high costs of tocilizumab therapy and other biologics: at doses used for rheumatoid arthritis patients, the cost for tocilizumab ranges from $179.20 to $896 per dose for the IV form and $355 for the pre-filled syringe [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349513/table/T43/].
Cyclosporine may be a more cost-effective and readily-available alternative than biologics [@url:https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&context=meyers_pp], if it proves effective against the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Another approach is the development of antivirals, which could be broad-spectrum, specific to coronaviruses, or targeted to SARS-CoV-2.
Given the increasingly apparent role of the cytokine storm in disease pathogenesis, it is possible that antivirals could be less effective in more severe cases of COVID-19, but this is not yet known; regardless, it is likely that early-stage patients could benefit from antiviral therapy.
The potential for remdesivir as an antiviral has already been described in an above section. 
Development of new antivirals is complicated by the fact that none have yet been approved for human coronaviruses.
Intriguing new options are emerging, however.
Beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an orally bioavailable ribonucleotide analog showing broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses, which may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].
Various other antivirals are in development.
Development of antivirals will be further facilitated as research reveals more information about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell and host cell genome, mechanisms of viral replication, mechanisms of viral assembly, and mechanisms of viral release to other cells; this can allow researchers to target specific stages and structures of the viral life cycle.

Antibodies against viruses, also known as antiviral monoclonal antibodies, could be an alternative as well and are described in detail in an above section.
The goal of antiviral antibodies is to neutralize viruses through either cell-killing activity or blocking of viral replication [@doi:10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.005].
They may also engage the host immune response, encouraging the immune system to hone in on the virus.
Given the cytokine storm that results from immune system activation in response to the virus, which has been implicated in worsening of the disease, a neutralizing antibody (nAb) may be preferable.
Upcoming work may explore the specificity of nAbs for their target, mechanisms by which the nAbs impede the virus, and improvements to antibody structure that may enhance the ability of the antibody to block viral activity.

In the longer term, as more information becomes available about the structures of SARS-CoV-2 components, small molecule inhibitors of those components may become candidates for drug discovery.
For example, crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease have recently been resolved [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; @url:https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html#].
Efforts have already been in place to perform screens for small molecule inhibitors of the main protease, yielding potential hits [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882].
Much work remains to be done to determine further crystal structures of other viral components, understand the relative utility of targeting different viral components, perform additional small molecule inhibitor screens, and determine the safety and efficacy of the potential inhibitors.
While still nascent, work in this area is promising.
