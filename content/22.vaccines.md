## Vaccine Development Strategies for SARS-CoV-2

### Abstract

Vaccines have revolutionized the relationship between people and disease.
In the 21^st^ century, a number of emergent viruses have emphasized the importance of rapid and scalable vaccine development programs.
During the pandemic caused by _Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2), recent biotechnological advances in vaccine design provided the circumstances for the development and deployment of vaccines at an unprecedented pace.
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was released on January 10^th^, 2020, allowing for global efforts in vaccine development to begin within two weeks of the international community becoming aware of the new viral threat.
Both pre-existing vaccine platforms and novel vaccine technologies have been explored against SARS-CoV-2.
Although historically a slow process, vaccine development in the face of COVID-19 accelerated so much that less than a year into the pandemic, some vaccine candidates had reported interim phase III clinical trial data and were being administered in countries around the world.
In this review, we examine the strategies used to develop the leading vaccine candidates and where these candidates currently stand in terms of efficacy, safety, and approval in light of the ongoing pandemic and threat from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
We also discuss the patterns of distribution around the world.
Vaccine development began almost five centuries ago, but the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides an exceptional illustration of how rapidly vaccine development technology has evolved in the last two decades.

### Importance

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused untold damage to the global population, but it also presented some unique opportunities for vaccine development.
As of {{csse_date_pretty}}, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over {{csse_cases}} and cost the lives of {{csse_deaths}} people globally.
The development, production, and distribution of vaccines is imperative to saving lives, preventing illness, and reducing the economic and social burdens caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now that promising candidates exist, effective deployment will provide an opportunity to move into a new phase of the pandemic where the susceptibility of worldwide populations is significantly reduced.
This review provides a historical context for vaccine devleopment and highlights the main strategies utilized for the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, their clinical appraisal, and their distribution.
These technologies have revolutionized the timescale at which countries can mount a response to an emerging viral threat and provide potential for mitigating future threats before their damage reaches the levels caused by SARS-CoV-2.
As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved, they also provide insight into how these technologies have to adapt on incredibly short timescales. 

### Introduction

The development of vaccines is widely considered one of the most important medical advances in recent human history.
Over the past 150 years, approaches to vaccine developments have undergone a transformation and the diversity of available strategies has grown [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Since the turn of the millennium, particular interest has emerged in the potential to develop vaccines as a rapid response to emerging threats.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), "swine flu" (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola all underscored the importance of a rapid global response to a new infectious virus, but the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
However, the _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted a confluence of circumstances that positioned vaccine development as a key player in efforts to control the virus and mitigate its damage.
Examining the vaccine development programs tackling the COVID-19 pandemic alongside other 21^st^ century efforts to control emerging viral threats demonstrates the significant biotechnological advances in this field.

### Historical Vaccine Development

The first vaccination strategy in human history is widely considered to be the practice of variolation, which makes the history of vaccine development almost 500 years long [@doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2].
Famously employed as a strategy to improve survival of smallpox by, for example, exposing a healthy individual to pus from smallpox pustules [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611; @doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2005.07.021; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2], variolation provides a mechanism for infecting a healthy individual with a mild case of a disease.
This strategy aims to confer adaptive immunity, but it also carries a number of risks for the vaccine recipient [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032].
This approach was (debatably) the first example of a live-attenuated virus being used to induce immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; 10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
Many subsequent efforts to develop live-attenuated viral vaccines relied on either the identification of related zoonotic viruses that are less virulent in humans (e.g., cowpox/horsepox or rotavirus vaccines) or efforts to attenuate the virus through culturing it _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611].
This approach still carried risks, however [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].

Efforts to overcome the limitations of live-virus vaccines led to the development of approaches to inactivate viruses (circa 1900) and to purify proteins from viruses cultured in eggs (circa 1920) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1402981111].
Inactivated viral vaccines still raised some concerns, however, including that back-mutations could potentially lead the inactivated vaccines to become virulent or that recombination could occur between the inactivated virus and other viruses in circulation [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
For example, errors in the manufacturing process that produced polio vaccines containing live polio virus led to a polio outbreak in the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp048180].
Concerns about contamination are shared across several vaccination platforms, including those that use live and attenuated viruses [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611].
Additionally, one of the major limitations of inactivated whole-virus vaccines is their susceptibility to lose efficacy due to mutations in the epitopes of the circulating virus [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
This loss of specificity over time is likely to be influenced by the evolution of the virus, and specifically by the rate of evolution in the region of the genome that codes for the antigen.

With the increased feasibility of genetic research in the 1980s came the application of genetic engineering to vaccine development, which allowed for the growth of the gene sequences of specific viral antigens _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111].
While vaccine development strategies such as live-attenuation and inactivation remain in use in the 21st century [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1400472111], approaches built off of the principles of genetic engineering offer some of the most dynamic opportunities in the field of modern vaccine development.

### 21^st^ Century Advances in Vaccine Development

![
**Vaccine Development Strategies.**
Several different strategies can and are being employed for the development of vaccines today.
Each approach capitalizes on different features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and delivery through a different platform.
All of these approaches are being explored in the current pandemic.<!--To Do: define LNP, define mRNA, define S protein. Swap order so viral particles are on top, then DNA, then viral vector, then RNA panels? Not sure if adenovirus/lentivirus is consistent with the rest of the text, need to double-check before finalizing figure. Change viral particle to inactivated whole virus-->
](images/N002-Vaccines.png){#fig:vaccines secno=1}

While traditional methods of vaccine development such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (Figure @fig:vaccines), biomedical research in the 21st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution, and vaccine development is no exception.
<!--To Do: note which methods had produced successful vaccines in the 1900s and which were new in the genomic era.-->
Building on the advances in vaccine development that came out of genetic engineering, several newer approaches to vaccine development today utilize information available in the DNA sequence of a virus (Figure @fig:vaccines).

In traditional DNA vaccines, the sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought can be cultivated in a plasmid and delivered directly to an appropriate tissue [@url:https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/].
Plasmids are not the only vector that can be used to deliver sequences associated with viral antigens: genetic material from the target virus can also be delivered using a second virus as a vector.
Once the plasmid or viral vector brings the DNA sequence to an antigen presenting cell (APC), the host machinery can be used to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, and the body can then synthesize antibodies in response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].

More recently, interest has also emerged the potential for viral RNA to induce an immune response (Figure @fig:vaccines).
This approach operates one level above the DNA: instead of directly furnishing the gene sequence associated with an antigen to the host, it provides the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA sequence.
Some of the potential advantages of mRNA compared to DNA include safety, as it cannot be integrated by the host and the half life can be regulated, it avoids any issues of a host immune response against the vector, and it holds the potential to dramatically accelerate vaccine manufacturing and development [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].

These two appraoches are based on a similar underlying principle: utilizing a vector to deliver the information the host needs to produce an antigen, which in turn triggers an immune response to the antigen without introducing an infectious agent.
In addition to lacking an infectious agent, both of these approaches are likely to offer several advantages over more traditional immunization platforms because they can stimulate both B- and T-cell responses [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.008; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Current methods in vaccine development can therefore be framed in terms of the central dogma of genetics: instead of directly providing the proteins from the infectious agents, vaccines developers are exploring the potential for the delivery of DNA or RNA to induce the cell to produce proteins from the virus that in turn induce a host immune response.

All of these technologies are fairly new.
<!--To Do: When did DNA vaccines really hit market? + same for viral vector vaccine, ebola was first-->
Prior to 2020, no mRNA vaccines had been approved for use in humans<!--To Do: Cite-->, despite significant advances in the development of this technology [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Vaccine development using mRNA is a recent frontier, with challenges in its execution arising from the instability of mRNA molecules, the design requirements of an efficient delivery system, and the potential for mRNA to elicit a very strong immune response [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].
Therefore, while these technologies elegantly capitalize on decades of research in vaccine development as well as the tools of the genomic revolution, it was largely unknown prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic whether this potential could be realized in a real-world vaccination effort.

### The Pursuit of Rapid, Scalable Vaccine Development

The requirements for a successful vaccine trial and deployment are complex and may require coordination between government, industry, academia, and philanthropic entities [@doi:10.1126/science.abc5312].
Flu-like illnesses caused by viruses are a common target of vaccine development programs, and influenza vaccine technology in particular has made many strides.
Beyond the seasonal flu, however, a number of emergent viral threats over the past 20 years have challenged the vaccine development pipeline to respond more rapidly to previously unknown viruses.
<!--To Do: SARS-->
During the H1N1 influenza outbreak, vaccine development was accelerated because of the existing infrastructure, along with the fact that regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the production and distribution of the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
<!--To Do: MERS, then Ebola-->
<!--To Do: add a sentence about adjuvants and link to appendix-->
The potential for technologies such as DNA and RNA vaccines to benefit the field of oncology has encouraged vaccine developers to invest in next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432].

### Challenges and Opportunities in Developing a Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 rapidly induced a global public health crisis.
This viral threat did not follow the same trajectory as other emergent viruses of recent note, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and ebola virus, none of which reached the level of pandemic.
Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has remained out of control in many parts of the world well into 2021, especially with the emergence of variants that have increased rates of transmission [@individual-pathogenesis].
While, for a variety of reasons, SARS-CoV-2 was not controlled as rapidly as the viruses underlying prior 21^st^ century epidemics, vaccine development technology had also progressed based on these and other prior viral threats to the point that a rapid international vaccine development response was possible.
The first critical step towards developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was characterizing the viral target, which happened extremely early in the COVID-19 outbreak with the sequencing and dissemination of the viral genome in early January 2020 [@url:https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/] (Figure @fig:virus).
<!--To Do: Focus on S protein, and specifically RBD-- is there anything else being examined we should talk about?-->
The _S_ protein (Figure @fig:virus) is an antigen and induces an immune response [@doi:10/fmq2; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.576622].

**Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.**
The development of vaccines depends on the immune system recognizing the virus.
Here, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is represented both in the abstract and against a visualization of the virion.
The abstracted visualization was made using BioRender [@url:https://biorender.com/] and the microscopy was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [@url:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/novel-coronavirus-sarscov2-images].
](images/SARS_CoV_2.png){#fig:virus secno=1}

For a highly infectious virus like SARS-CoV-2, a vaccine would hold particular value because it could bolster the immune response to the virus of the population broadly, thereby driving a lower rate of infection and likely significantly reducing fatalities.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of September 2020, there were over 180 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in development [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3].
While little is currently known about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development typically tests for serum neutralizing activity, as this has been established as a biomarker for adaptive immunity in other respiratory illnesses [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
However, unlike in efforts to develop vaccines for prior viral threats, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it possible to test vaccine in phase III trials, where the effect of the vaccine on a cohort's likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2 can be evaluated.
Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.
These diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches (Figure @fig:vaccines).

### Live-Attenuated Viruses

Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV), or replication-competent vaccines, use a weakened living version of a disease-causing virus or a version of a virus that is modified to induce an immune response [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 
The virus can be attenuated by passaging it in a foreign host until, as a consequence of selection pressure, the virus loses its efficacy in the original host. 
Alternatively, selective gene deletion or codon de-optimization can be utilized to attenuate the virus [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 
LAVs are used globally to prevent diseases caused by viruses such as measles, rubella, polio, influenza, varicella zoster, and the yellow fever virus [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-35761-6.00002-X].
It is generally recognized that LAVs induce an immune response similar to natural infection, and they are favored because they induce long-lasting and robust immunity that can protect from disease. 
This strong protective effect is induced in part by the immune response to the range of viral antigens available from LAV, which tend to be more immunogenic than those from non-replicating vaccines [@url:https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.032; @doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256]. 
LAVs are also favored because they tend to be restricted to viral replication in the tissues around the location of inoculation [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951], and some can be administered intranasally [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2798-3]. 

The first deliberate attempt to utilize an attenuated viral vaccine dates back to Louis Pasteur in 1885, despite his not knowing that the disease-causing agent he was experimenting with was a virus. 
Indeed, the next intentional LAVs developed were intended to prevent illness caused by the yellow fever virus in 1935, followed by the first influenza vaccine in 1936 [@doi:10.1128/9781555818951]. 
Although LAV development strategies have the longest history, this strategy has not been widely utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 
There is general concern that LAV strategies may risk causing disease in individuals who are immunocompromised [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2007.10.010], which is an even greater concern when dealing with a novel virus and disease. 
Previously, there have been numerous attempts to develop both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV LAVs [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.602256], but no vaccines were approved for use in humans.
While safety in production was a major concern in the past, nowadays manufacturers of LAVs use safe and reliable methods to produce large quantities of vaccines once they have undergone rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy.

There are at least five COVID-19 LAV candidates at various stages of vaccine development.
A single-dose LAV candidate referred to as YF-SO used live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) as a vector for a noncleavable prefusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen.
This LAV has been assessed in hamsters, mice, and macaques [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].
YF-SO induced a robust immune response in all three animal models and prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques and hamsters [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9].
Other LAVs being investigated for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 include a Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine sponsored by institutes in Australia in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is in phase III clinical testing [@clinicaltrials:NCT04327206]. 
A second investigation using a BCG vaccine is also ongoing, which is led by Texas A&M University in collaboration with numerous other U.S. institutions [@clinicaltrials:NCT04348370].
The purpose of the BCG vaccine is to prevent tuberculosis; however, it is known to exert protective non-specific effects against other respiratory tract infections in _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies [@doi:10.1016/j.cmi.2019.04.020], hence the interest many have for its potential use against COVID-19 [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0337-y].

In April 2020, it was announced that the Indian Immunologicals Ltd. and Griffith University Australia had partnered to develop codon de-optimized LAV [@url:https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/04/23/griffith-university-researchers-on-the-road-to-covid-19-vaccine]; however, there have been no updates on the findings of their preclinical testing. 
Another codon de-optimized LAV is being developed by Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University and Acibadem Labmed Health Services A.S., which also has yet to report the findings of its preclinical tests [@url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org].
Following successful preclinical investigation [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2102775118], an intranasally administered deoptimized SARS-CoV-2 LAV known as COVI-VAC was developed by both New York-based Codagenix and the Serum Institute of India. 
COVI-VAC entered phase I human trials and dosed its first participants in January 2021 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04619628; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org].  
It is anticipated that the COVI-VAC phase I human trials will be completed by May 2022.
Similarly,  Meissa Vaccines in Kansas, U.S.A., which also develops vaccines for _Respiratory syncytial virus_ (RSV), began enrollment for phase I human trials on an intranasal live-attenuated chimeric vaccine candidate in March 2021 for which recruitment is ongoing [@clinicaltrials:NCT04798001; @url:https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org].

Despite the long and trusted history of LAV development, this vaccine strategy does not appear to be favored for vaccine development against COVID-19.
Modern technologies such as mRNA vaccines and vectored vaccines seem to have been favored due to their expediency and safety versus the time-consuming nature of developing LAVs using a novel virus.  

### Inactivated Whole-Virus Vaccines

Another well-established technology, inactivated whole-virus vaccines, is under development against SARS-CoV-2.
This platform has been a valuable tool in efforts to control many viruses, and some well-known whole virus vaccines targets include influenza viruses, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus.
These types of vaccines use full virus particles that have been rendered non-infectious by chemical (i.e., formaldehyde or &beta;-propiolactone [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1357471]) or physical (i.e., heat) means.
Though these virus particles are inactivated, they still have the capacity to prime the immune system.
The size of the virus particle makes it ideal for uptake by APC, which leads to stimulation of helper T-cells [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
Additionally, the array of epitopes on the surface of the virus increases antibody binding efficiency [@doi:10.1038/nri2868].
The native conformation of the surface proteins, which is also important for eliciting an immune response, is preserved using these techniques.
Membrane proteins, which support B-cell responses to surface proteins, are also included using this method [@doi:10.1084/jem.164.4.1114].
Overall, these vaccines are able to mimic the key properties of the virus that stimulate a robust immune response, but the risk of adverse reactions is reduced because the virus is inactivated and thus unable to replicate.

<!--To Do: Were these investigated for SARS, MERS, ebola, H1N1?-->

One prominent inactivated whole-virus vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is being developed by Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company.
Their CoronaVac vaccine uses an inactivated whole virus with the addition of an aluminum adjuvant [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2020.585354] and is currently in Phase III clinical trials in Brazil [@doi:10.1186/s13063-020-04775-4].
<!--To Do: Expand slightly (1-2 sentences) on how it is made -- how do they inactivate it?-->
Phase I and II clinical trials indicated a strong immunogenic response in animal models and the development of neutralizing antibodies in human participants [@doi:10/fx8z; @doi:10.1126/science.abc1932; @doi:10/fpcx].
<!--To Do: Check if there are any specifics available about immunogenicity that we can compare across vaccines...-->
Safety analysis of the vaccine during the phase II trial revealed that most adverse reactions were either mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity.<!--To Do: check this, original text said "all" but that is in conflict with 2 lines below-->
The most common symptom was pain at the injection site (9%) and fever (3%), and only 2% (n=7) of participants participants reported severe adverse events, though these were determined to be unrelated to the vaccine.
While data from the phase III study will be required to evaluate the efficacy of the virus under real-world conditions of exposure, the current results suggest that this vaccine is likely to adapt a well-established approach to vaccine development for the prevention of COVID-19.<!--To Do: these vaccines are not doing so well against variants supposedly-->

<!--To Do: reorganize text from paragraph below, maybe some moves to appendix-->
India, the biggest producer of vaccines globally, has developed COVAXIN®, which is an indigenous COVID-19 vaccine researched and manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). 
Bharat Biotech reported 80.6% vaccine efficacy for its whole virion inactivated  BBV152 (COVAXIN®) vaccine candidate in 25,800 participants in phase III clinical trials [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-phase3-efficacy-results.pdf; @url:https://www.biogenetech.co.th/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-Ocugen.pdf]. 
It was reported in _The Lancet_ that the BBV152 vaccine candidate adjuvanted with alum and a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist is safe, immunogenic, and induces Th1-skewed memory T-cell responses upon immunization [@doi:10/gh7597].
Importantly, sera from individuals vaccinated with COVAXIN^®^ efficiently neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant and the heterologous strain of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.26.426986].
U.S.-based Ocugen Inc., a  co-development partner of Bharat Biotech, is leading the application for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVAXIN™ intended for the U.S. market. 
As of April 1, 2021 COVAXIN® has been approved for emergency use in Iran, Zimbabwe, and Nepal, and Mauritius and Paraguay have received a commercial supply of the vaccine.
In Asia, China and India are the main COVID-19 vaccination developers and providers.
Thus far, over 63 million people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in India [@url:https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/].
A broad range of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under investigation in order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In India, the Covaxin vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech received emergency authorization on January 3rd, 2021, despite the lack of phase III data until March 3rd [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-phase3-efficacy-results.pdf].
Following the release of the phase III data indicating 81% efficacy, Zimbabwe authorized the use of Covaxin [@url:http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/04/c_139783893.htm].
In addition to COVAXIN®, Bharat Biotech has also developed an adenovirus vector-based intranasal BBV154 vaccine candidate that induces neutralizing IgG, mucosal IgA, and T cell responses [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/intranasal-vaccine.html]. 
In February, 2021, Bharat Biotech received approval from Indian officials to commence a phase I study of this intranasal chimpanzee-adenovirus (ChAd) vectored SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine [@url:https://www.bharatbiotech.com/intranasal-vaccine.html]. 
Another Indian pharmaceutical industry, Zydus Cadila is developing India’s first indigenous DNA vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.26.428240]  which has completed phase I and II clinical trials and has received approval from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct a phase III clinical trial [@url:https://vaccine.icmr.org.in/covid-19-vaccine].
Moreover, Indian-based Biological E.Limited has partnered with U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company Dynavax Technologies Corporation and Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial in India for its COVID-19 subunit vaccine, which consists of the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@url:https://vaccine.icmr.org.in/covid-19-vaccine]. 
Notably, Novavax has signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India allowing them to produce up to 2 billion doses a year [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax-idUSKBN2661PI].
Novavax has also signed agreements with the U.K., Canada, Australia, and South Korea [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement] and has projected that they will supply 1.1 billion doses to COVAX who will distribute the vaccines to countries with disadvantaged access to vaccine supplies [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
India has vaccinated approximately 24 million people [@url:https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/].
This has been achieved by mainly using the AstraZeneca-University of Oxford vaccine, known as Covishield in India, which is also produced by the Serum Institute of India, and using India’s own Covaxin vaccine [@url:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124].
India has also shipped approximately 58 million COVID-19 vaccines to 66 countries [@url:https://www.mea.gov.in/vaccine-supply.htm]
Considering India produces approximately 60% of the world's vaccines prior to the pandemic, it is no surprise that several other vaccine candidates are under development.
These include ZyCov-Di, a DNA vaccine produced by Zydus Cadila, HGCO19, India’s first mRNA vaccine produced by Genova and HDT Biotech Corporation (of the U.S.), and the Bio E subunit vaccine produced by Biological E in collaboration with U.S.-based Dynavax and the Baylor College of Medicine [@url:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124].

CoronaVac has been approved for use in China and has been granted emergency use in Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uruguay [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html#sinovac].<!--To Do: clean citation-->

Delays in vaccine distribution have also caused issues, particularly in Turkey where 10 million doses of Sinovac were due to arrive by December 2020, but instead only 3 million were delivered in early January [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/business/china-covid-19-vaccine-backlash.html].
Similar delays and shortages of doses promised have been reported by officials in the Philippines, Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates [@url:https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/philippines-receive-covid-19-vaccine-delays-76163594; @url:https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-makers-struggle-to-meet-demand-11612958560].

### Protein Subunit Vaccines

<!--To Do: Add to figure-->
Compared to the inactivated whole virus vaccines, these protein subunit vaccines isolate a single protein of the virus and use it to stimulate the immune system.
These proteins, also known as antigens, are usually those located on the surface of the viral particle and are therefore key targets of the immune system.
These proteins are typically grown in yeast and then harvested.
This vaccine can stimulate antibodies and CD4^+^ T-cell response [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-1823-5].
The main advantage of this method is that protein subunit vaccines are considered very safe, as the antigen alone cannot cause an infection.
However, the immune response is weaker and an adjuvant is usually needed to boost the response [@doi:10.1517/14712598.2011.573624] (see Appendix).
<!--To Do: Application/advancements in prior 21st century epidemics?-->

NVX-CoV2373, produced by U.S. company Novavax, is a protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is constructed from a mutated prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in combination with a specialized adjuvant to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.
The spike protein is recombinantly expressed in Sf9 insect cells [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8], which have previously been used for several other FDA-approved protein therapeutics [@doi:10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00985] and contains mutations in the furin cleavage site (682-RRAR-685 to 682-QQAQ-685) along with two proline substitutions (K986P and V987P) that improve thermostability [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8].
In preclinical mouse models, Novavax-CoV2373 elicited high anti-spike IgG titers 21 to 28 days post-vaccination that could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and protect the animals against virus challenge, with particularly strong effects when administered with the proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M^TM^ [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20653-8].
In a phase I/II trial, a two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 was found to induce anti-spike IgG levels and neutralizing antibody-titers exceeding those observed in convalescent plasma donated by symptomatic patients [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2026920].
In line with the preclinical studies, the use of Matrix-M adjuvant further increased anti-spike immunoglobulin levels and induced a Th1 response.
Although the phase III trial data has not been published yet, Novavax announced an efficacy of 89.3% based on their phase III trial in the UK and also noted that 90% of cases occurring in their phase IIb study in South Africa were caused by a variant of concern, B.1.351 [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3].
Despite these very preliminary results, Novavax has signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India allowing them to produce up to 2 billion doses a year [@url:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax-idUSKBN2661PI] and has also signed agreements with the U.K., Canada, Australia, and South Korea [@url:https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement] as well as projecting that they will supply 1.1 billion doses to COVAX for distribution to countries with limited access to vaccine supplies [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
<!--To Do: closing sentence contextualizing role protein subunit vaccines may play in this pandemic relative to previous ones-->

### Vaccines Delivering DNA

The delivery and presentation of antigens is fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus such as SARS-CoV-2.
DNA vaccines offer an approach to delivering foreign substances into the body in a way that induces both a humoral and cellular immune response [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Delivering a DNA sequence to host cells allows the host to synthesize an antigen without exposure to a viral threat [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Host-synthesized antigens can then be presented in complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II, which can activate either T- or B-cells [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
While these vaccines encode specific proteins, providing many of the benefits of a protein subunit vaccine, they do not carry any risk of DNA being live, replicating, or spreading, and their manufacturing process lends itself to scalability [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Many of the safety concerns raised about DNA vaccines were not found to be an issue during preclinical and phase I testing, although antibiotic resistance introduced during the plasmid selection process remained a concern during this initial phase of development [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
However, the immunogenicity of these vaccines has also not reached expectations [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
<!--To Do: Expand. I have a bunch of papers downloaded about why this such a groundbreaking technology, need to read and summarize-->

#### DNA Vaccines

In the 1990s and 2000s, DNA vaccines delivered via plasmids sparked significant scientific interest, leading to a large number of preclinical trials [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Early preclinical trials primarily focused on long-standing disease threats, including viral diseases such as rabies and bacterial diseases such as malaria, and promising results led to phase I testing of the application of this technology to HIV, influenza, malaria, and other diseases of concern during this period [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
Although they were well-tolerated, these early attempts to develop vaccines were generally not very successful in inducing immunity to the target pathogen, with either limited T-cell or limited neutralizing antibody responses observed [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
<!--To Do: Plasmid DNA vaccines for other 21st century epidemics, and the coming-of-age of this technology in the late 00s-->

<!--To Do: Add background on how the INO-4800 vaccine is designed-->
Currently, a Phase I safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of INO-4800, a prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, is underway [@clinicaltrials:NCT04336410].
The vaccine developer Inovio Pharmaceuticals Technology is overseeing administration of INO-4800 by intradermal injection followed by electroporation with the CELLECTRA® device to healthy volunteers.
Electroporation is the application of brief electric pulses to tissues in order to permeabilize cell membranes in a transient and reversible manner.
It has been shown that electroporation can enhance vaccine efficacy by up to 100-fold, as measured by increases in antigen-specific antibody titers [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.008].
The safety of the CELLECTRA® device has been studied for over seven years, and these studies support the further development of electroporation as a safe vaccine delivery method [@doi:10.4161/hv.24702].
The temporary formation of pores through electroporation facilitates the successful transportation of macromolecules into cells, allowing cells to robustly take up INO-4800 for the production of an antibody response.
Approved by the United States (U.S.) FDA on April 6, 2020, the phase I study is enrolling up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia, PA at the Perelman School of Medicine and at the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, MO.
The trial has two experimental arms corresponding to the two locations.
Participants in Experimental Group 1 will receive one intradermal injection of 1.0 milligram (mg) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device twice, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Participants in Experimental Group 2 will receive two intradermal injections of 1.0 mg (total 2.0 mg per dosing visit) of INO-4800 followed by electroporation using the CELLECTRA® 2000 device, administered at Day 0 and Week 4.
Safety data and the initial immune responses of participants from the trial are expected by the end of the summer of 2021.
The development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by Inovio could be an important step forward in the world's search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Although exciting, the cost of vaccine manufacturing and electroporation may make scaling the use of this technology for prophylactic use for the general public difficult.

#### Viral-Vector DNA Vaccines

Viral vectors have emerged as a safe and efficient method to furnish the nucleotide sequences of an antigen to the immune system using a second virus as a vector [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16].
The genetic content of the vector virus is often altered to prevent it from replicating, but replication-competent viruses can also be used under certain circumstances [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2016.05.014].
The vaccine then uses the host machinery to construct antigen(s) from the transported genetic material, for which the body synthesizes antibodies in response.
One of the early viral vectors explored was adenovirus, with serotype 5 (Ad5) being particularly effective [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
This technology rose in popularity during the 2000s due to its being more immunogenic in humans and non-human primates than plasmid-vectored DNA vaccines [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432].
In the 2000s, interest also arose in utilizing simian adenoviruses as vectors because of the reduced risk that human vaccine recipients would have prior exposure resulting in adaptive immunity [@doi:10.1038/nrg2432; @doi:10.1038/mt.2013.284], and chimpanzee adenoviruses were explored as a potential vector in the development of a vaccine against _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.3390/v12080861].
Today, various viral-vector platforms including poxviruses [@doi:10/cnw6vw; @doi:10.4161/hv.28974], adenoviruses [@doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130], and vesicular stomatitis viruses [@pmid:10196265; @doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2004.03.003] are being developed,
Viral-vector vaccines are able to induce both an antibody and cellular response; however, the response is limited due to the immunogenicity of the viral vector used [@doi:10.1016/j.coi.2011.03.006; @doi:10.1038/mt.2009.130].
An important consideration in identifying potential vectors is the immune response to the vector.
Both the innate and adaptive immune responses can potentially respond to the vector, limiting the ability of the vaccine to transfer information to the immune system [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Different vectors are associated with different levels of reactogenicity; for example, adenoviruses elicit a much stronger innate immune response than replication deficient adeno-associated viruses derived from parvoviruses [@doi:10.1038/gt.2009.148].
Additionally, using a virus circulating widely in human populations as a vector presents additional challenges because vaccine recipients may already have developed an immune response to the vector [@doi:10.3390/vaccines2030624].

There are several viral vector vaccines that are available for veterinary use [@doi:10.3390/vaccines8040680; @doi:10.1038/nrg2432], but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, only one viral vector vaccine was approved by the FDA for use in humans.
This vaccine is vectored with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus and targeted against the ebola virus [doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.011].
Additionally, several phase I and phase II clinical trials for other vaccines are ongoing [@doi:10.1128/CVI.00298-16], and the technology is currently being explored for its potential against numerous infectious diseases including malaria [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.11.003; @doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.07.035], ebola [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1410863; @doi:10.1093/infdis/jir349; @doi:10.1586/14760584.2014.885841], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [@doi:10.1097/COH.0b013e328363d389; @doi:10.1016/j.virol.2014.09.004].
The threat of MERS and SARS initiated interest in the application of viral vector vaccines to human coronaviruses [@doi:10.3390/v12080861], but efforts to apply this technology to these pathogens had not yet led to a successful vaccine candidate.
In the mid-to-late 00s, adenoviral vectored vaccines against SARS were found to induce SARS-CoV-specific IgA in the lungs of mice [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.81579-0], but were later found to offer incomplete protection in ferret models [@doi:10.1099/vir.0.2008/001891-0].
Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow sought to use an adenovirus platform for the development of vaccines for _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ and Ebola virus, although neither of the previous vaccines were internationally licensed [@url:https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2018/october/2_Ebola_SAGE2018Oct_BgDoc_20180919.pdf].

In 2017, results were published from an initial investigation of two vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV containing the MERS-CoV S gene vectored with chimpanzee adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1), a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.032].
This study reported that a candidate containing the complete spike protein sequence induced a stronger neutralizing antibody response in mice than candidates vectored with modified vaccinia virus Ankara.
It was pursued in additional research, and in the summer of 2020 results of two studies were published.
The first reported that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS induced an immune response and inhibited viral replication in macaques [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba8399].
The second reported  promising results from a phase I trial that administered the vaccine to adults and measured safety/tolerability and immune response (as indicated through immune assays following vaccination) [@doi:10/ggtxgp].

While not all of these results were available at the time that vaccine development programs against SARS-CoV-2 began, at least three viral vector vaccines have also been developed against this hCoV.
First, collaboration between AstraZeneca and researchers at the University of Oxford has successfully applied a viral vector approach to the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using the replication-deficient ChAdOx1 vector modified to encode the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y].
In phase I and I/II trials, respectively, the immunogenic potential of vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was demonstrated through the immune challenge of two animal models, mice and rhesus macaques [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2608-y] and patients receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that peaked by day 28, with these levels remaining stable until a second observation at day 56 [@doi:10/gg5gwk].
In December 2020, preliminary results of the phase III trial were released detailing randomized control trials conducted in the U.K., Brazil, and South Africa between April and November 2020 [@doi:10/fmq2].
These trials again compared ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 to a control, but the design of each study varied; pooling data across studies indicated an overall efficacy of 70.4%. <!--To Do: symptomatic?-->
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was first approved for emergency use on December 30, 2020 in the United Kingdom [@url:https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-authorised-in-uk.html] and has since then been approved for emergency use in several dozen countries, in addition to receiving full approval in Brazil.

Second, a viral vector approach was also applied by Gamaleya to develop Sputnik V, a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vaccine that combines two adenovirus vectors, rAd26-S and rAd5-S, that express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.
The two vectors are administered intramuscularly administered sequentially, following a prime-boost regimen.
Despite a lack of data from clinical trials, President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced the approval of the Sputnik V vaccines on August 11th, 2020 [@doi:10/ft7j] and it has subsequently been administered in Russia and other countries.
Subsequently, the phase I/II clinical trial was published and indicated that the vaccine was safe, with the most common adverse events being mild pain at the injection site (58%), hypothermia (50%), headaches (42%), fatigue (28%), and joint and muscle pain (24%), and immunogenic, with seroconversion observed in all participants three weeks after the second dose and with all participants producing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein [@doi:10/gg96hq].
In February 2021, six months after its approval in Russia, interim results of the phase III trial were released, indicating an overall vaccine efficacy of 91.6% for symptomatic COVID-19 [@doi:10/ghxj4g].
As of early January, Sputnik V had been administered to as many as 1.5 million Russians [@url:https://www.brusselstimes.com/news-contents/world/149039/1-5-million-people-have-received-sputnik-v-vaccine-russia-says-russian-direct-investment-fund-mikhail-murashko/] , and doses of Sputnik V have also been distributed to other parts of Europe, such as Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, San Marino, Serbia, and Slovakia [@url:https://www.euronews.com/2021/02/12/hungary-to-begin-using-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-today; @url:https://www.euronews.com/2021/02/24/san-marino-buys-russia-s-sputnik-v-after-eu-vaccine-delivery-delays; @url:https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/12/29/belarus-starts-coronavirus-vaccination-with-sputnik-v-a72512], with the Czech Republic and Austria also having expressed interest in its procurement [@url:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/russias-sputnik-vaccine-is-luring-eastern-europe-worrying-the-eu.html].

Third, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, also developed a viral vector vaccine in collaboration with and funded by the United States's “Operation Warp Speed” [@url:https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319; @url:https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use].
The vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735, formerly known as Ad26.COV2-S, is a monovalent vaccine that is composed of a replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the stabilized prefusion S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201;@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x]. 
Unlike the other two viral vector vaccines available to date, JNJ-78436735 requires only a single dose, a characteristic that is expected to aid in global deployment [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z].
JNJ-78436735 was selected from among a number of initial candidate designs [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x] and tested _in vivo_ in Syrian golden hamsters and Rhesus macaques to assess safety and immunogenicity [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z; @doi:10.1038/s41591-020-1070-6; @doi:10.1101/2020.11.17.368258].
The JNJ-78436735 candidate was selected for its favorable immunogenicity profile and ease of manufacturability [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2607-z; @doi:10.1038/s41591-020-1070-6; @doi:10.1101/2020.11.17.368258] and was found to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaques even after six months [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.30.428921].
The one- versus two-dose regimen was tested in volunteers through a phase I/IIa trial [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201], although these results are not yet available; however, the study did report that the vaccine was well-tolerated and that most participants demonstrated seroconversion in a neutralization assay 29 days after immunization [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034201].
The phase III trial is ongoing across several countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, and the U.S.), but interim results were reported in a press release on January 29th, 2021 [@url:https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/janssen-investigational-covid-19-vaccine-interim-analysis-phase-3-clinical-data-released; @url:https://www.janssen.com/emea/sites/www_janssen_com_emea/files/johnson_johnson_announces_single-shot_janssen_covid-19_vaccine_candidate_met_primary_endpoints_in_interim_analysis_of_its_phase_3_ensemble_trial.pdf].
The vaccine was well-tolerated, and across all regions studied, it was found to be 66% effective after 28 days for the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19 and to be 85% effective for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 as well as 100% protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death.
However, the reported efficacy ranged from 57% in South Africa to 72% in the United States, suggesting that these observations might be influenced by the prominent viral strains circulating in each country at the time of the trial; at the time, several variants of concern including B.1.351, which was first identified in South Africa [@url:https://cov-lineages.org/global_report_B.1.351.html], were being monitored.

The three viral-vector vaccines described above have demonstrated the potential for this technology to facilitate a quick response to an emerging pathogen.
However, two of the three vaccines have faced a number of criticisms surrounding the implementation of their clinical trials.
<--To Do: Suggestion to move some of the Sputnik controversy here, along with describing the issues with the AstraZeneca trial-->
Additionally, though the vaccines are developed using similar principles, there are some differences that might influence their efficacy as SARS-CoV-2 evolves.
In the Janssen vaccine, the S protein immunogen is stabilized in its prefusion conformation, while in the Sputnik V and AstraZeneca vaccines, it is not.
The prefusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is metastable [@doi:10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118056], and the release of energy during membrane fusion drives this process forward following destabilization [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301; @doi:10.1038/nature17200].
Due to the significant conformational changes that occur during membrane fusion [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058; @doi:10.1016/j.str.2020.10.001; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2665-2], S protein immunogens that are stabilized in the prefusion conformation are of particular interest, especially because a prefusion stabilized MERS-CoV S antigen was found to elicit an improved antibody response [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114].
Moreover, the prefusion conformation offers an opportunity to target S2, a region of the S protein that accumulates mutations at a slower rate [@doi:10.3390/v4061011; @doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1707304114] (see also [@individual-pathogenesis]).
Vaccine developers can use versions of the spike protein that contain mutations that stabilize the prefusion conformer, essentially locking them in this position [@doi:10.1126/science.abd0826].
The immune response to the spike protein when it is stabilized in this conformation is improved over other S structures [@doi:10.1038/s41541-020-00243-x].
Thus, vaccines that use this prefusion stabilized conformation, including the Janssen viral-vector vaccine, the Novavax-CoV2373 protein nanoparticle vaccine, as well as the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines, are expected to not only offer improved immunogenicity, but also be more resilient to the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2.
How these differences in design influence the efficacy of these three viral-vector vaccines over time remains to be seen.

### RNA Vaccines

Building on DNA Vaccine technology, RNA vaccines are an even more recent advancement for vaccine development.
RNA vaccines are nucleic-acid based modalities that code for viral antigens against which the human body elicits a humoral and cellular immune response.
The mRNA technology is transcribed _in vitro_ and delivered to cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNP) [@doi:10.1002/eji.1830230749].
They are recognized by ribosomes _in vivo_ and then translated and modified into functional proteins [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
The resulting intracellular viral proteins are displayed on surface MHC proteins, provoking a strong CD8+ T cell response as well as a CD4+ T cell and B cell-associated antibody responses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Naturally, mRNA is not very stable and can degrade quickly in the extracellular environment or the cytoplasm.
The LNP covering protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation outside of the cell [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006].
Codon optimization to prevent secondary structure formation and modifications of the poly-A tail as well as the 5’ untranslated region to promote ribosomal complex binding can increase mRNA expression in cells.
Furthermore, purifying out double-stranded RNA and immature RNA with FPLC (fast performance liquid chromatography) and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) technology will improve translation of the mRNA in the cell [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].

There are three types of RNA vaccines: non-replicating, _in vivo_ self-replicating, and _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Non-replicating mRNA vaccines consist of a simple open reading frame (ORF) for the viral antigen flanked by the 5’ UTR and 3’ poly-A tail.
_In vivo_ self-replicating vaccines encode a modified viral genome derived from single-stranded, positive sense RNA alphaviruses [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594; @doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
The RNA genome encodes the viral antigen along with proteins of the genome replication machinery, including an RNA polymerase.
Structural proteins required for viral assembly are not included in the engineered genome [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Self-replicating vaccines produce more viral antigens over a longer period of time, thereby evoking a more robust immune response [@url:https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines].
Finally, _in vitro_ dendritic cell non-replicating RNA vaccines limit transfection to dendritic cells.
Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting immune cells that easily take up mRNA and present fragments of the translated peptide on their MHC proteins, which can then interact with T cell receptors.
Ultimately, primed T follicular helper cells can stimulate germinal center B cells that also present the viral antigen to produce antibodies against the virus [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.004].
These cells are isolated from the patient, grown and transfected _ex vivo_, and reintroduced to the patient [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2017.243].

Vaccines based on mRNA delivery confer many advantages over traditional viral vectored vaccines and DNA vaccines.
In comparison to live attenuated viruses, mRNA vaccines are non-infectious and can be synthetically produced in an egg-free, cell-free environment, thereby reducing the risk of a detrimental immune response in the host [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007].
Unlike DNA vaccines, mRNA technologies are naturally degradable and non-integrating, and they do not need to cross the nuclear membrane in addition to the plasma membrane for their effects to be seen [@doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594].
Furthermore, mRNA vaccines are easily, affordably, and rapidly scalable.
Although mRNA vaccines have been developed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, none have previously been licensed or commercialized.
Nevertheless, they have shown promise in animal models and preliminary clinical trials for several indications, including rabies, coronavirus, influenza, and cytomegalovirus [@clinicaltrials:NCT01669096].
Preclinical data previously identified effective antibody generation against full-length FPLC-purified influenza hemagglutinin stalk-encoding mRNA in mice, rabbits, and ferrets [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05482-0].
Similar immunological responses for mRNA vaccines were observed in humans in Phase I and II clinical trials operated by the pharmaceutical-development companies Curevac and Moderna for rabies, flu, and zika [@doi:10.1080/14760584.2017.1355245].
Positively charged bilayer LNPs carrying the mRNA attract negatively charged cell membranes, endocytose into the cytoplasm [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006], and facilitate endosomal escape.
LNPs can be coated with modalities recognized and engulfed by specific cell types, and LNPs that are 150 nm or less effectively enter into lymphatic vessels [@doi:10.4155/tde-2016-0006; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06936-1].
Therefore, this technology holds great potential for targeted delivery of modified mRNA.
<!-- To Do: development of this tech during previous epidemics?-->

Given the potential for this technology to be quickly adapted for a new pathogen, it has held significant interest for the treatment of COVID-19.
In the vaccines developed under this approach, the mRNA coding for a stabilized prefusion spike protein, which is immunogenic [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], can be furnished to the immune system in order to train its response.
Two vaccine candidates in this category emerged with promising phase III results at the end of 2020.
Both require two doses approximately one month apart.
The first was Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, which contains the full prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a vaccine formulation based on modified mRNA (modRNA) technology [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a014035; @url:https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-early-positive-data-ongoing-0].
<!--To Do: brief history of phase I & phase II (like 1-2 sentences)-->
In the phase II/III multinational trial, this vaccine was associated with a 95% efficacy against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with mild-to-moderate local and systemic effects but a low risk of serious adverse effects [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2034577].
Similarly, ModernaTX developed mRNA-1273, which, despite being the second mRNA vaccine to release phase III results, was the first mRNA vaccine to enter phase I clinical trials.
mRNA-1273 is comprised by a conventional lipid nanoparticle encapsulated RNA encoding a full-length prefusion stabilized S protein for SARS-CoV-2 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04283461].
In the phase I trial, neutralizing activity reached similar levels to that observed in convalescent plasma samples by day 7 after the second dose of RNA-1273 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022483].
A few months later, interim results from the phase III trial indicated 94.5% efficacy of the vaccine in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in adults who received the vaccine at 99 sites around the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389].
Similar to BNT162b2, the vaccine was associated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects but with a low risk of serious adverse events [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035389]. 
In late 2020, both vaccines both received approval from the United States's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization [@url:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19; @url:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e1.htm], and these vaccines have been widely distributed, primarily in North America and the European Union [@url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html].
As the first mRNA vaccines to make it to market, these two highly efficacious vaccines demonstrate the power of this emerging technology, which has previously attracted scientific interest because of its potential to be used to treat non-infectious as well as infectious diseases.

### Discussion (Probably to be fleshed out into multiple sections)

Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.
However, the vaccine development process has historically been slow, and vaccines fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].

<!--To Do: Add table of different technologies and which vaccines fall under each, ability to respond to VOC-->

Concerns: diversity of volunteer pools, variants, and distribution
Another benefit of vaccines is lower population size in SARS-CoV-2 = less risk of VOC emerging that are less susceptible to the vaccine
