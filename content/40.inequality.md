### Introduction

_Severe acture respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) virus has become a serious worldwide threat since late 2019.
The scientific community has responded by rapidly collecting information and conducting research about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated illness, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides important insight into the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disease's effect on the human body [@individual-pathogenesis].
Similarly, a thorough understanding of the biology of the human host is also critical to understanding the clinical manifestations of the disease.
A complete perspective on this disease therefore also requires considering factors that shape variation in human biology, including the environmental factors that are known to influence COVID-19 outcomes.

During the pandemic, a number of risk factors have been associated with COVID-19
These include health conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease [@url:https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963; @doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.021].
An observed association among racial and ethnic background and COVID-19 outcomes has also led to racial and ethnic minorities frequently being included on the list of groups with increased susceptibility (e.g., [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html]).
However, it is well documented that these health conditions occur at higher rates in communities of color.<!-- To Do: Add citation-->
Additionally, social factors such as poverty, housing instability, pollution, and incarceration are likely to play a role in driving discrepancies among racial and ethnic groups and COVID-19 outcomes.<!-- To Do: Add citation-->
Such social factors have become determinants of individual- and community-level risks related to COVID-19 and are therefore also a critical component of any analysis of COVID-19 pathology.


Here, we argue that social, economic, and environmental factors shape an individual's biology in ways that intersect with the pathology of COVID-19.
In particular, the social factors associated with COVID-19 drive chronic stress, which can in turn alter an individual's biology in ways that are likely to make them more susceptible to COVID-19.
Because the sources of chronic stress that are most commonly associated with COVID-19 susceptibility are promoted by systemic racism, we argue that it is the experience of racism, not an individual's ancestry, that is associated with more severe outcomes of COVID-19.
While some efforts have been made to acknowledge ethnicity and race as correlates of social and environmental influences (e.g., [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/covid-data/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.pdf]), rarely is the potential biological basis for these connections explored.
Therefore, COVID-19 risk must be considered in the context of not only social and environmental but also biological mechanisms through which systemic racism can drive the heavy toll of the pandemic on communities of color.

In this review, we seek to contextualize the social factors associated with COVID-19 severity and to explore how the biological implications of chronic stress intersect with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
First, we outline the potential biological basis of several risk factors that have been identified for COVID-19.
While the term risk factors implies that they themselves predispose an individual to increased susceptibility of infection and more severe COVID-19 outcomes, we argue that this is a more nuanced question where the interrelatedness of these factors and their association with poverty and racism must be considered.
Next, we discuss how the conditions presented by systematic discrimination may predispose some individuals both to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and to more severe outcomes of the disease it causes.
Many of the social factors associated with elevated allostatic load are also correlated with the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the first place.
Finally, we address the relationship between allostatic load and COVID-19 on a functional biological level.
Severe COVID-19 outcomes are known to be driven by systemic inflammation, which is in turn exacerbated by chronic social stressors.
Through this review, the goal is to contextualize the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in the embodiment framework, examine how some proposed therapeutics intersect with the biology of chronic stress, and persuade the reader that diversity in scientific research and scientific researchers is critical to developing robust strategy for mitigating the damage of COVID-19 in society as a whole. 
No biological analysis of the impact of COVID-19 can be complete without acknowledgement of the social factors that shape its outcomes.
This review thus serves to recontextualize the rest of this special issue within the context of embodiment and chronic stress.

### Embodiment as a Framework for Understanding COVID-19

The idea that experience can shape an individual's biology is a principle known as embodiment [@doi:10.1136/jech.2004.024562].
This paradigm contextualizes individual behaviors, environmental exposures, or other lifestyle factors in a broader social context [@doi:10.1136/jech.2004.024562].
In particular, it offers the advantage of disentangling related, but etiologically distinct, factors such as race and racism.
In cases where ancestry is correlated with environmental exposures, for example, embodiment provides a framework to determine whether the correlation is driven by discriminatory social beliefs that are themselves correlated with ancestry [@doi:10.1136/jech.2004.024562].
For example, one analysis [@doi:10.2105/AJPH.2005.065615] examined cardiac health in Puerto Rico in an embodiment framework by comparing social perceptions about skin color with the actual physical properties (i.e., reflectance spectrophotometry) of skin within different communities.
This study revealed that it was the perception of someone's skin color, not its physical properties, that was associated with blood pressure [@doi:10.2105/AJPH.2005.065615].
These analyses illuminate the fact that most studies that identify race as a risk factor fail to consider the correlated variable of racism (see [@doi:10.1002/ajpa.20983]).

Embodiment emerged in an ecosocial and epidemiological context [@doi:10.1136/jech.2004.024562], but it is also fundamentally linked to biology.
Stress, though an adaptive response to a perceived threat, harbors a maladaptive component: the same chemicals and hormones that promote survival of an acute threat have detrimental physiological effects when an individual remains in an aroused state (i.e., stressed) over time [@doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08103.x].
The negative effects of chronic stress are known as allostatic load [@doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09546.x].
The well-documented health risks associated with allostatic load are etiologically linked to the stress response itself via the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
For example, glucocorticoids, whose levels fluctuate with stress, influence the risk of sepsis [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2007.05.003], and hyperactivity of the amygdala combined with metabolic shifts and inflammation may promote development of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes [@doi:10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.08.019; @doi:10/dqkn6t; @doi:10.1073/pnas.081072698; @doi:10.1001/archinte.1997.00440400111013; @doi:10.1093/rheumatology/38.11.1050].
Additionally, chronic stress may expedite physical and mental decline associated with age [@doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09040461; @doi:10.1001/archinte.1997.00440400111013].
Other health conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, and cancer have also been linked to allostatic load [@doi:10.1001/archinte.1997.00440400111013; @doi:10.1073/pnas.081072698].
These health disparities render chronic stress a risk factor on a biological level.
Additionally, the list of risks associated with allostatic load closely echoes the list of comorbidities associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.

### COVID-19 "Risk Factors"

As COVID-19 has spread into communities around the globe, it has become clear that the risks associated with this disease are not equally shared by all individuals or all communities.
Significant disparities in outcomes have led to interest in the demographic, biomedical, and social factors associated with COVID-19 severity.
Untangling the factors that influence COVID-19 outcomes is a complex undertaking.
Among patients who are admitted to the hospital, outcomes have generally been poor, with rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) upwards of 15% in both Wuhan, China and Italy [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2002032; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4031].
However, hospitalization rates vary by location [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
This variation may be influenced by demographic (e.g., average age in the area), medical (e.g., the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes), and social (e.g., income or healthcare availability) factors that vary geographically.
As a result, quantifying or comparing susceptibility among individuals, communities, or other groups requires consideration of a number of complex phenomena that intersect across many disciplines of research.
Importantly, discriminatory racial attitudes and other sources of social stratification are also likely to vary geographically. 
Thus, in this section, the term "risk factors" is used to identify variables that are statistically associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Some are intrinsic characteristics that have been observed to carry an association with variation in outcomes, whereas others may be more functionally linked to the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
These variables will then be contextualized into a broader social and biological framework below.

#### Patient Traits Associated with Increased Risk

Two traits that have been consistently associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes are male sex and advanced age (typically defined as 60 or older, with the greatest risk among those 85 and older [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html]).
In the United States, males and older individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were found to be more likely to require hospitalization [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1].
A retrospective study of hospitalized Chinese patients [@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age, and world-wide, population age structure has been found to be an important variable for explaining differences in outbreak severity [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004911117].
The case fatality rate (CFR) for adults over 80 has been estimated upwards of 14% or even 20% [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472].
Male sex has also been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including death [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985; @doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9; @url:https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/].
Early reports from China and Europe indicated that even though the case rates were similar across males and females, males were at elevated risk for hospital admission, ICU admission, and death [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9], although data from some US states indicates more cases among females, potentially due to gender representation in care-taking professions [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
In older age groups (e.g., age 60 and older), comparable absolute numbers of male and female cases actually suggests a higher rate of occurrence in males, due to increased skew in the sex ratio with age [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Current estimates based on worldwide data suggest that, compared to females, males may be 30% more likely to be hospitalized, 80% more likely to be admitted to the ICU, and 40% more likely to die as a result of COVID-19 [@url:https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/].
There also may be a compounding effect of advanced age and male sex, with differences of time to recovery that are worst for males over 60 years old relative to female members of their age cohort [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008520].
Social factors may also influence risks related to both age and sex: for example, older adults are more likely to live in care facilities, which have been a source for a large number of outbreaks [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcaa136], and gender roles may also influence exposure and/or susceptibility due to differences in care-taking and/or risky behaviors (e.g., caring for elder relatives and smoking, respectively) [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9] among men and women.

Both of these risk factors can be interpreted through the lens of biology.
The biological basis for greater susceptibility with age is likely linked to the prevalence of extenuating health conditions such as heart failure or diabetes [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472].
For individuals experiencing chronic stress over the course of their lifetime due to factors such as racism or poverty, the prevalence of these conditions would likely be even higher [@doi:10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09040461; @doi:10.1001/archinte.1997.00440400111013; @doi:10.1073/pnas.081072698].
Greater severity of illness with advanced age is typical of many infectious diseases, and therefore this association is not unexpected [@doi:10.1086/313792].
As for the association of sex with COVID-19 severity, several hypotheses have been proposed.
For example, some evidence suggests that female sex hormones may be protective [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the enzyme used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells, in the kidneys of male mice was observed to be twice as high as that of females, and a regulatory effect of estradiol on ACE2 expression was demonstrated by removing the gonads and then supplementing with estradiol [@doi:10.1186/2042-6410-1-6; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Other work in mice has shown an inverse association between mortality due to the closely related virus SARS-CoV-1 and estradiol, suggesting a protective role for the sex hormone [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Evidence also suggests that similar patterns might be found in other tissues.
A preliminary analysis identified higher levels of ACE2 expression in the myocardium of male patients with aortic valve stenosis than female patients, although this pattern was not found in controls [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Additionally, research has indicated that females respond to lower doses than males of heart medications that act on the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway, which is shared with ACE2 [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Several components of the immune response, including the inflammatory response, may also differ in intensity and timing between males and females [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570; @doi:10.1186/2042-6410-1-6].
This hypothesis is supported by some preliminary evidence showing that female patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 had higher antibody titers than males [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Sex steroids can also bind to immune cell receptors to influence cytokine production [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Thus, both age and sex are thought to have some intrinsic relationship to risk, but also to be correlated with social factors contributing to risk, although it should be noted that both transgender men and women are suspected to be at heightened risk [@url:https://escholarship.org/uc/item/55t297mc].

#### Comorbid Health Conditions

A number of pre-existing or comorbid conditions have repeatedly been identified as risk factors associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Several underlying health conditions were identified at high prevalence among hospitalized patients, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
Higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores have been associated with a higher probability of mortality [@doi:10/ggnxb3], and comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular and lung diseases as well as obesity were also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death, even when correcting for age and sex [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985].
SOFA was developed for the assessment of organ failure in the context of sepsis, and the acronym originally stood for sepsis-related organ failure assessment [@doi:10.1007/BF01709751; @doi:10.1001/jama.2016.0287]; sepsis is a common immediate cause of death among COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.15.20131540; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0235458].
Diabetes may increase the duration of hospitalization [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021] and the risk of death [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021;@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].
Obesity also appears to be associated with higher risk of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042].
Dementia and cancer were also associated with the risk of death in an analysis of a large number (more than 20,000) of COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985].

These health conditions affect biology in ways that are thought to overlap with the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
Analyses investigating possible functional relationships between diabetes and COVID-19 have revealed that _ACE2_ expression may be elevated in individuals with diabetes mellitus [@doi:10.2337/dc20-0643] and that ketoacidosis, a metabolic disorder typically associated with diabetes, is observed in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes [@doi:10.1111/dom.14057].
These findings suggest that the pathology of diabetes may overlap with the pathology of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00124.2020].
Although a clear functional connection between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes are not yet established [@doi:10.1016/j.medj.2020.06.005], obesity is correlated with other comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and pulmonary disease, as well as to chronic inflammation [@doi:10.1007/s11695-020-04677-z].
Dementia and other forms of cognitive decline are thought to be functionally related to diabetes [@doi:10/c3tm55], and both cancer and dementia are related to chronic inflammation [@doi:10.1038/nature01322; @doi:10.1186/s13195-015-0117-2].

It should be noted that such comorbid conditions are inextricably tied to age, as conditions tend to be accumulated over time, but that the prevalence of individual comorbidities or of population health overall can vary regionally [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2008760117].
Several comorbidities that are highly prevalent in older adults, such as COPD, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, have been associated with CFRs upwards of 8% compared to an estimate of 1.4% in people without comorbidities [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472; @url:https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)]. <!--To Do: will this url work for Manubot?-->
Therefore, both age and health are important considerations when predicting the impact of COVID-19 on a population [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2008760117].
Additionally, certain conditions are likely to be more prevalent under or exacerbated by social conditions, especially poverty, as is discussed further below.

#### Ancestry

A number of studies have suggested associations between individuals' racial and ethnic backgrounds and their COVID-19 risk.
In particular, Black Americans are consistently identified as carrying a higher burden of COVID-19 than white Americans [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1], with differences in the rates of kidney complications from COVID-19 particularly pronounced [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006].
Statistics from a number of cities indicate significant discrepancies between the proportion of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Black Americans relative to their representation in the general population [@doi:10/ggv494].
In addition to Black Americans, disproportionate harm and mortality from COVID-19 has also been noted in Latino/Hispanic Americans and in Native American and Alaskan Native communities, including the Navajo nation [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.8598; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m1483; @doi:10.1111/jrh.12451; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html?searchResultPosition=10; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html; @doi:10.1093/tbm/ibaa055; @url:https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jisd/article/view/70753/54416].
In Brazil, indigenous communities likewise carry an increased burden of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1126/science.abc0073].
In the United Kingdom, nonwhite ethnicity (principally Black or South Asian) was one of several factors found to be associated with a higher risk of death from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4].

From a genetic standpoint, it is highly unlikely that ancestry itself predisposes individuals from these diverse groups to experiencing severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Human genetic diversity varies over a geographic continuum, and that most human genetic variation is associated with the African continent [@doi:10.1038/ng1438].
African-Americans are also a more genetically diverse group relative to European-Americans, with a large number of rare alleles and a much smaller fraction of common alleles identified in African-Americans [@doi:10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164258].
Therefore, the idea that African ancestry (at the continental level) might convey some sort of genetic risk for severe COVID-19 contrasts with what is known about worldwide human genetic diversity [@doi:10.1126/science.abd4842].
The possibility for genetic variants that confer some risk or some protection remains possible, but has not been widely explored, especially on a global scale.<!--To Do: Check if there are updates here, I think I remember seeing some-->
Research in Beijing of a small number (n=80) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed an association between severe COVID-19 outcomes and homozygosity for an allele in the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene, which was selected as a candidate because it was previously found to be associated with influenza outcomes in Chinese patients [@doi:10.1093/infdis/jiaa224].
Genetic factors may also play a role in the risk of respiratory failure for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283; @doi:10.1093/gerona/glaa131; @doi:10.1101/2020.06.16.155101].
However, genetic variants associated with outcomes within ancestral groups are far more common than genetic variants explaining outcomes between groups.
Alleles in _ACE2_ and transmembrane protease serine protease-2, which is involved in proteolytic priming of SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry [@individual-pathogenesis], have been identified to vary in frequency among ancestral groups [@doi:10.1186/s12916-020-01673-z], but whether these variants are associated with COVID-19 susceptibility has not been explored.

Instead, examining patterns of COVID-19 susceptibility on a global scale that suggest that social factors are of primary importance in predicting mortality.
Reports from several sub-Saharan African countries during 2020 indicated that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were less severe than anticipated based on the outbreaks in China and Italy.
In Kenya, for example, estimates of national prevalence based on testing blood donors for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between April and June 2020 were consistent with approximately 5% of Kenyan adults having recovered from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1126/science.abe1916].
This high seroprevalence of antibodies lies in sharp contrast to the low number of COVID-19 fatalities in Kenya, which by the median date of sampling was 71 out of 2093 known cases [@doi:10.1101/2020.07.27.20162693].
Likewise, a serosurvey of health care workers in Blantyre City, Malawi reported an adjusted antibody prevalence of 12.3%, suggesting that the virus had been circulating more widely than thought and that the death rate was up eight times lower than models had predicted [@doi:10.1101/2020.07.30.20164970].
While several possible hypotheses for the apparent reduced impact of COVID-19 on the African continent were explored, such as young population demographics in many places [@doi:10.1126/science.369.6505.756], these reports present a stark contrast to the severity of COVID-19 in Americans and Europeans of African descent.
In late 2020, the continent began facing a second wave that has proven to be more deadly [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.24288], but the initial success of many African country's management of COVID-19 still lies in stark contrast to the trends observed for populations of African descent in the United States and United Kingdom.
Additionally, while the youthfulness of many African cities may have insulated populations during the first wave, ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom also tend to be younger than white British living in the same areas, yet the burden of COVID-19 is still more serious for minorities, especially people of Black Caribbean ancestry, both in absolute numbers and when controlling for age and location [@url:https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/].
Therefore, simple explanations such as demographics do not seem sufficient to explain the different trajectories of infection among locations.

The groups in the United States and United Kingdom that have been identified as carrying elevated COVID-19 burden, namely Black American, indigenous American, and Black and South Asian British, are quite distinct in their position on the human ancestral tree.
What is shared across these groups is instead a history of disenfranchisement under colonialism and ongoing systematic racism.
A large analysis of over 11,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 92 hospitals across U.S. states revealed that Black patients were younger, more often female, more likely to be on Medicaid, more likely to have comorbidities, and came from neighborhoods identified as more economically deprived than white patients [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039].
This study reported that when these factors were accounted for, the differences in mortality between Black and white patients were no longer significant.
Thus, the current evidence suggests that the apparent correlations between ancestry and health outcomes must be examined in the appropriate social context.

### Environmental Influences on Susceptibility

There are distinct components to COVID-19 susceptibility, and an individual's risk can be elevated at one or all stages from exposure to recovery/mortality: an individual may be more likely to be exposed to the virus, more likely to get infected once exposed, more likely to have serious complications once infected, and be less likely to receive adequate care once they are seriously ill.
The fact that one analysis found differences in survival between Black and white patients were no longer significant after controlling for comorbidities and socioeconomic status (type of insurance, neighborhood deprivation score, and hospital where treatment was received) in addition to sex and age [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039] underscores the relevance of social factors to understanding mortality differences between racial and ethnic groups.
Moreover, the Black patients analyzed in this study were younger and more likely to be female than white patients, yet still had a higher mortality rate without correction for the other variables [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039].
These results indicate that factors tied to socioeconomic status are likely to be fundamental to understanding COVID-19 risk.
Here, we outline a few systemic forces that may exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of color.

#### Exposure to COVID-19

Social distancing has emerged as one of the main social policies used to manage the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries.
Many governments issued stay-at-home orders, especially in the initial months of the crisis.
However, data clearly indicates that these orders impacted different socioeconomic groups differently.
In U.S. counties with and without stay-at-home orders, smartphone tracking indicated a significant decrease in the general population's mobility in April relative to February through March of 2020 (-52.3% and -60.8%, respectively) [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
A linear relationship was observed between counties' reduction in mobility and their wealth and health, as measured by access to health care, food security, income, space, and other factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Counties with greater reductions in mobility were also found to have much lower child poverty and household crowding and to be more racially segregated, and to have fewer youth and more elderly residents [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Similar associations between wealth and decreased mobility were observed in cellphone GPS data from Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico collected between January and May 2020 [@arXiv:2006.15195], as well as in a very large data set from several US cities [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2923-3].

These disparities in mobility are likely to be related to the role that essential workers have played during the pandemic.
Essential workers are disproportionately likely to be female, people of color, immigrants, and to have an income below 200% of the poverty line [@url:https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf].
Black Americans in particular are over-represented among front-line workers and in professions where social distancing is infeasible [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145].
Health care work in particular presents an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0232452; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationshavethehighestpotentialexposuretothecoronaviruscovid19/2020-05-11; @url:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892085/disparities_review.pdf].
In the United Kingdom, (South) Asians are more likely than their white counterparts to be medical professionals [@url:https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/], although BAME medical professionals are still disproportionately represented in the proportion of National Health Service staff deaths [@url:https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article].
Similar trends have been reported for nurses, especially nurses of color, in the United States [@url:https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/0920_Covid19_SinsOfOmission_Data_Report.pdf].
Furthermore, beyond the risks associated with work itself, use of public transportation may also impact COVID-19 risk [@url:http://www.nber.org/papers/w27407].
The socioeconomic and racial/ethnic gaps in who is working on the front lines of the pandemic make it clear that socioeconomic privilege is likely to decrease the probability of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Increased risk of exposure can also arise outside the workplace.
Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities received attention early on as high-risk locations for COVID-19 outbreaks [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.11642].
The services provided in long-term care facilities can vary widely, with a lower quality of care frequently available to racial and ethnic minorities who need these services [@doi:10.1080/08959420.2020.1772004].
Prisons and detention centers also confer a high risk of exposure or infection [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.1856; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12528], and in the United States, incarcerated people are more likely to be male and persons of color, especially Black [@url:https://www.issuelab.org/resources/695/695.pdf].
Additionally, multi-generational households are less common among non-Hispanic white Americans than people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds [@doi:10.1111/j.1751-9020.2010.00306.x], increasing the risk of exposure for more susceptible family members.
Analysis suggests that household crowding may also be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 exposure [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624], and household crowding is associated with poverty [@doi:10.1037/12057-014].
Forms of economic insecurity like housing insecurity, which is associated with poverty and more pronounced in communities subjected to racism [@doi:10.7916/D8WH2W9T; @doi:10.1093/socpro/spv025], would be likely to increase household crowding and other possible sources of exposure.
As a result, facets of systemic inequality, such as the mass incarceration of Black Americans and intergenerational poverty, are likely to increase the risk of exposure outside of the workplace.

#### Severity of COVID-19 Following Exposure

Following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the likelihood that an individual develops COVID-19 and the severity of the disease presentation can be influenced by a number of social factors.
As discussed above, a number of patient characteristics are associated with the likelihood of severe COVID-19 symptoms.
In some cases, these trends run counter to those expected given rates of exposure: for example, although women are more likely to be exposed, men are more likely to be diagnosed with, hospitalized from, or die from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
In the case of comorbid conditions and racial/ethnic demographics, however, social factors are highly likely to modulate or at least influence the apparent association between these traits and the increased risk from COVID-19.
In particular, the comorbidities and racial/ethnic correlates of severe COVID-19 outcomes suggest that poverty confers additional risk for COVID-19.

In order to explore the relationship between poverty and COVID-19 outcomes, it is necessary to consider how poverty impacts biology.
In particular, we focus on the United States and the United Kingdom.
Comorbidities that increase risk for COVID-19, including obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are known to be intercorrelated [@doi:10/bpp37d].
Metabolic conditions related to heightened inflammation, like obesity, type II diabetes, and hypertension, are more strongly associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes than other comorbid conditions, such as chronic heart disease [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
As discussed above, dysregulated inflammation characteristic of cytokine release syndrome is one of the greatest concerns for COVID-19-related death.
Therefore, it is possible that chronic inflammation characteristic of these metabolic conditions predisposes patients to COVID-19-related death [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
The association between these diseases and severe COVID-19 outcomes is a concern from a health equity perspective because poverty exposes people to "obesogenic" conditions [@doi:10/gddg84] and is therefore unsurprisingly associated with higher incidence of obesity and associated disorders [@doi:10.5604/12321966.1120608].
Furthermore, cell phone GPS data suggests that lower socioeconomic status may also be associated with decreased access to healthy food choices during the COVID-19 pandemic [@doi:10.1002/oby.22940; @doi:10.1002/oby.22993], suggesting that health-related risk factors for COVID-19 may be exacerbated as the pandemic continues [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.07.002].
Chronic inflammation is a known outcome of chronic stress (e.g., [@doi:10.1067/mai.2000.110163; @doi:10.1037/0278-6133.21.6.531; @doi:10.1037/a0025536; @doi:10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00450.x]).
Therefore, the chronic stress of poverty is likely to influence health broadly (as summarized in [@doi:10.1038/scientificamerican1205-92]) and especially during the stress of the ongoing pandemic.

Environmental disparities may also influence differences in COVID-19 outcomes.
A preprint [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502] provided observational evidence that geographical areas in the United States that suffer from worse air pollution by fine particulate matter have also suffered more COVID-19 deaths per capita, after adjusting for demographic covariates.<!--To Do: update reference: 10.1126/sciadv.abd4049 -->
Although a lack of individual-level exposure data and the impossibility of randomization make it difficult to elucidate the exact causal mechanism, this finding would be consistent with similar findings for all-cause mortality (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1803222115]).
Exposure to air pollution is associated with both poverty (e.g., [@doi:10.3390/ijerph15061114]) and chronic inflammation [@doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.002].
Other outcomes of environmental racism, such as the proximity of abandoned uranium mines to Navajo land, can also cause respiratory illnesses and other health issues [@url:https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jisd/article/view/70753/54416].
Similarly, preliminary findings indicate that nutritional status (e.g., vitamin D deficiency and other nutritional deficiencies [@individual-nutraceuticals]) may be associated with COVID-19 outcomes, and reduced access to grocery stores and fresh food often co-occurs with environmental racism [@url:https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jisd/article/view/70753/54416; @doi:10.1056/NEJMp2021264].

Taken together, the evidence suggests that low-income workers who face greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their home or work conditions are also more likely to face environmental and social stressors associated with increased inflammation.
Structural racism can play a role in disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 exposure due to consequences of racism such as an increased likelihood of poverty and its associated food and housing instability.
Unsurprisingly, this convergence of factors is also associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, including death.
COVID-19 can thus be considered a "syndemic", or a synergistic interaction between several epidemics [@doi:10.1002/ajhb.23482].
As a result, it is not surprising that people from minoritized backgrounds and/or with certain pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer severe effects of COVID-19, but these "risk factors" are likely to be causally linked to poverty [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.26443].

#### Access to Treatment

Finally, COVID-19 outcomes can be influenced by access to healthcare.
Receiving care for COVID-19 can, but does not always, include receiving a positive test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For example, it is common to see treatment guidelines for suspected cases regardless of whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036]).
Whether and where a patient is diagnosed can depend on their access to testing, which can vary both between and within countries.
In the United States, it is not always clear whether an individual will have access to free testing [@url:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/19/880543755/insurers-may-only-pay-for-coronavirus-tests-when-theyre-medically-necessary; @url:https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/private-health-insurance-coverage-covid-19-public-health-emergency].
The concern has been raised that more economic privilege is likely to correspond to increased access to testing, at least within the United States [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
This connection is supported by the fact that African Americans seem to be more likely to be diagnosed in the hospital, while individuals from other groups were more likely to have been diagnosed in ambulatory settings in the community [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598].
Any delays in treatment are a cause for concern [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046], which could potentially be increased by an inability to acquire testing because in the United States, insurance coverage for care received can depend on a positive test [@url:https://www.hrsa.gov/coviduninsuredclaim/frequently-asked-questions].

Another important question is whether patients with moderate to severe cases are able to access hospital facilities and treatments, to the extent that they have been identified.
Early findings from China as of February 2020 suggested the COVID-19 mortality rate to be much lower in the most developed regions of the country [@doi:10/ggqscd], although reported mortality is generally an estimate of CFR, which is dependent on rates of testing.
Efforts to make treatment accessible for all confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in China are credited with expanding care to people with fewer economic resources [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0823-6].
In the United States, access to healthcare varies widely, with certain sectors of the workforce less likely to have health insurance; many essential workers in transportation, food service, and other frontline fields are among those likely to be uninsured or underinsured [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
As of 2018, Hispanic Americans of all races were much less likely to have health insurance than people from non-Hispanic backgrounds [@url:https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf].
Therefore, access to diagnostics and care prior to the development of severe COVID-19 is likely to vary depending on socioeconomic and social factors, many of which overlap with the risks of exposure and of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.

This discrepancy ties into concerns about broad infrastructural challenges imposed by COVID-19.
A major concern in many countries has been the saturation of healthcare systems due to the volume of COVID-19 hospitalizations (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004064117]).
Similarly, there have been shortages of supplies such as ventilators that are critical to the survival of many COVID-19 patients, leading to extensive ethical discussions about how to allocate limited resources among patients [@doi:10.19044/esj.2020.v16n21p24; @doi:10.7249/PEA228-1; @arxiv:2008.00374; @doi:10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.044].
Although it is generally considered unethical to consider demographic factors such as age, sex, race, or ethnicity while making such decisions, and ideally this information would not be shared with triage teams tasked with allocating limited resources among patients [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137], there are substantial concerns about implicit and explicit biases against older adults [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16539], premature infants [@doi:10.1111/apa.15334], and people with disabilities or comorbidities [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764138; @doi:10.2105/AJPH.2020.305837; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137].
Because of the greater burden of chronic disease in populations subjected to systemic racism, algorithms intended to be blind to race and ethnicity could, in fact, reinforce systemic inequalities caused by structural racism [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1777347; @doi:10.1016/j.jnma.2020.05.010; @doi:10.1056/NEJMp2023616].
Because of this inequality, it has been argued that groups facing health disparities should be prioritized by these algorithms [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
This approach would carry its own ethical concerns, including the fact that many resources that need to be distributed do not have well-established risks and benefits [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].

As the pandemic has progressed, it has become clear that ICU beds and ventilators are not the only limited resources that needs to be allocated, and, in fact, the survival rate for patients who receive mechanical ventilation is lower than these discussions would suggest [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460].
Allocation of interventions that may reduce suffering, including palliative care, has become critically important [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1788663].
The ambiguities surrounding the risks and benefits associated with therapeutics that have been approved under emergency use authorizations also present ethical concerns related to the distribution of resources [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
For example, for much of 2020, remdesivir was available for the treatment of COVID-19 under compassionate use guidelines and through expanded access programs, and in many cases has been donated to hospitals by the manufacturer, Gilead [@doi:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.016; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Remdesivir is now the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.<!--To Do: cite therapeutics-->
Regulations guiding the distribution of drugs in situations like these typically do not address how to determine which patients receive them [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Prioritizing marginalized groups for treatment with a drug like remdesivir would have been unethical because it would entail disproportionately exposing these groups to a therapeutic for which the benefits and risks were not yet established [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
On the other hand, given that the drug was and remains one of the most promising treatments available for many patients, using a framework that tacitly feeds into structural biases would also be unethical.
At present, the report prepared for the Director of the CDC by Ethics Subcommittee of the CDC fails to address the complexity of this ethical question given the state of structural racism in the United States, instead stating that "prioritizing individuals according to their chances for short-term survival also avoids ethically irrelevant considerations, such as race or socioeconomic status" [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/about/advisory/pdf/VentDocument_Release.pdf].
In many cases, experimental therapeutics are made available only through participation in clinical trials [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795541].
However, given the history of medical trials abusing minority communities, especially Black Americans, there is a history of unequal representation in clinical trial enrollment [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795541].
As a result, the standard practice of requiring enrollment in a clinical trial in order to receive experimental treatment may also reinforce patterns established by systemic racism.
<!-- To Do: move down: Risk of comorbid health conditions associated with more severe outcomes may be influenced by long-term damage caused by chronic stress related to traumatic social experiences [@doi:10.1007/s12170-013-0338-5], perhaps mediated by cardiovascular risk factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253], although the effects of chronic stress have not yet been researched in the specific case of COVID-19 disparities.-->

#### Access to and Representation in Clinical Trials

Experimental treatments are often made available to patients primarily or even exclusively through clinical trials.
The advantage of this approach is that clinical trials are designed to collect rigorous data about the efficacy of a treatment as well as its safety.
The disadvantage is that access to clinical trials is not equal among all people who suffer from a disease.
Two important considerations that can impact an individual's access to clinical trials are geography and social perceptions of clinical trials.
For the first, the geographic distribution of trial recruitment efforts are typically bounded and can vary widely among difference locations, and for the second, the social context of medical interactions can impact strategies for and the success of outreach to different communities.
Differential access to clinical trials raises concerns because it introduces biases that can influence scientific and medical research on therapeutics and prophylactics broadly.
Concerns about bias in clinical trials need to address both trial recruitment and operation.
In the present crisis, such biases are particularly salient because COVID-19 is a disease of global concern, and COVID-19 studies that have included worldwide populations, such as the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Solidarity trial, do not always reach the same conclusions as those conducted exclusively within western, industrialized nations (e.g., remdesivir and tocilizumab <!--To Do: cite therapeutics-->).
Treatment is needed by people all over the world, and clinical research that characterizes treatment outcomes in a variety of populations is critically important.

Global representation in clinical trials is important to ensuring that experimental treatments are available equally to COVID-19 patients who may need them.
The advantage to a patient of participation in a clinical trial is that they may receive an experimental treatment they would not have been able to access otherwise.
The potential downsides of participation include that the efficacy and side effects of such treatments are often poorly characterized and that patients who enroll in clinical trials will in some cases run the risk of being assigned to a placebo condition where they do not receive the treatment and could miss out on opportunities to receive other treatments.
The benefits and burdens of clinical trials therefore need to be weighed carefully to ensure that they don't reinforce existing health disparities.
The WHO Director‐General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated his condemnation of utilizing low and middle income countries as test subjects for clinical trials, yet having highly developed countries as the majority of clinical trial representation is also not the answer [@doi:10.1002/eahr.500055].
Figure @fig:ebm-map showcases two choropleths detailing COVID-19 clinical trial recruitment by country.
China, the United States, and France are among the countries with the most clinical trial recruiting for trials with single-country enrollment.
Many countries have little to no clinical trial recruiting, with the continents of Africa and South America much less represented than Asia, Europe, and North America.
Trials that recruit across multiple countries do appear to broaden geographic representation, but these trials seem to be heavily dominated by the United States and European Union.

![
**Geographic distribution of COVID-19 clinical trials.**
The density of clinical trials is reported at the country level.
As of {{ebm_date_pretty}}, there are {{ebm_all_trials}} trials in the University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medicine Data Lab's COVID-19 TrialsTracker [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3732709], of which {{ebm_interv_trials}} are interventional.
The top figure demonstrates the density of interventional trials recruiting only from a singular country, while the bottom shows the distribution of recruitment for interventional trials that involve more than one country.
]({{ebm_map_figure}} "COVID-19 clinical trials"){#fig:ebm-map secno=1}

A few different concerns arise from this skewed geographic representation in clinical trial recruitment.
First, treatments such as remdesivir that are promising but primarily available to clinical trial participants are unlikely to be accessible by people in many countries.
Second, it raises the concern that the findings of clinical trials will be based on participants from many of the wealthiest countries, which may lead to ambiguity in whether the findings can be extrapolated to COVID-19 patients elsewhere.
Especially with the global nature of COVID-19, equitable access to therapeutics and vaccines has been a concern at the forefront of many discussions about policy (e.g., [@doi:10/ggq7mf], yet data like that shown in Figure @fig:ebm-map demonstrates that accessibility is likely to be a significant issue.
Another concern with the heterogeneous international distribution of clinical trials is that the governments of countries leading these clinical trials might prioritize their own populations once treatments or vaccines are developed, causing unequal health outcomes [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6641].
Additionally, even within a single state in the United States (Maryland), geography was found to influence the likelihood of being recruited into or enrolled in a clinical trial, with patients in under-served rural areas less likely to enroll [@doi:10.1016/j.cdp.2005.12.001].
Thus, geography both on the global and local levels may influence when treatments and vaccines are available and who is able to access them.
Efforts such as the African Union's efforts to coordinate and promote vaccine development [@doi:10/fgzk] are therefore critical to promoting equity in the COVID-19 response.

Even when patients are located within the geographic recruitment area of clinical trials, however, there can still be demographic inequalities in enrollment.
When efforts are made to ensure equal opportunity to participate in clinical trials, there is no significant difference in participation among racial/ethnic groups [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].
However, within the United States, real clinical trial recruitment numbers have indicated for many years that racial minorities, especially African-Americans, tend to be under-represented (e.g., [@doi:10.1001/jama.291.22.2720; @doi:10.1245/s10434-007-9500-y; @doi:10.1089/jwh.2010.2469; @doi:10.1007/s11926-018-0728-2]).
This trend is especially concerning given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans.
Early evidence suggests that the proportion of Black, Latinx, and Native American participants in clinical trials for drugs such as remdesivir is much lower than the representation of these groups among COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2021971].

One proposed explanation for differences among racial and ethnic groups in clinical trial enrollment refers to different experiences among patients in healthcare settings.
In the United States, many patients experience "othering" from physicians and other medical professionals due to their race or other external characteristics such as gender (e.g., [@doi:10.1207/S15327027HC1602_7]).
Many studies have sought to characterize implicit biases in healthcare providers and whether they affect their perceptions or treatment of patients.
A systematic review that examined 37 such studies reported that most (31) identified racial and/or ethnic biases in healthcare providers across many different roles, although the evidence about whether these biases translated to different attitudes towards patients was mixed [@doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.05.009], with similar findings reported by a second systematic review [@doi:10.1111/acem.13214].
However, data about real-world patient outcomes are very limited, with most studies relying on clinical vignette-based exercises [@doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.05.009], and other analyses suggest that physician implicit bias could impact the patient's perception of the negativity/positivity of the interaction regardless of the physician's explicit behavior towards the patient [@doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2009.11.004].
Because racism is a common factor in both, negative patient experiences with medical professionals are likely to compound other issues of systemic inequality, such as a lack of access to adequate care, a lack of insurance, or increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1542/peds.2020-003657].
Furthermore, the experience of being othered is not only expected to impact patients' trust in and comfort with their provider, but also may directly impact whether or not the patient is offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial at all.
Some studies suggest communication between physicians and patients impacts whether or not a physician offers a patient participation in a clinical trial.
For example, researchers utilized a linguistic analysis to assess mean word count of phrases related to clinical trial enrollment, such as voluntary participation, clinical trial, etc. [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].
The data indicated that the mean word count of the entire visit was 1.5 times more for white patients in comparison to Black patients.
In addition, the greatest disparity between white and Black patients' experience was the discussion of risks, with over 2 times as many risk-related words spoken with white patients than Black patients [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483].
While some plausible reasons for the disparity in communication between physicians and patients could be a lack of awareness and education, mistrust in healthcare professionals, and a lack of health insurance [@doi:10.1002/cncr.28483], a major concern is that patients from certain racial and ethnic groups are marginalized even while seeking healthcare.
The trends observed for other clinical trials raise the concern that COVID-19 clinical trial information may not be discussed as thoroughly or as often with Black patients compared to white patients.

These discrepancies are especially concerning given that many COVID-19 treatments are being or are considered being made available to patients prior to FDA approval through Emergency Use Authorizations.
In the past, African-Americans have been over-represented relative to national demographics in use of the FDA's Exception From Informed Consent (EFIC) pathway [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0501].
Through this pathway, people who are incapacitated can receive an experimental treatment even if they are not able to consent and there is not sufficient time to seek approval from an authorized representative.
This pathway presents concerns, however, when it is considered in the context of a long history of systematic abuses in medical experimentation where informed consent was not obtained from people of color, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiments [@doi:10.1067/mem.2003.17].
While the goal of EFIC approval is to provide treatment to patients who urgently need it, the combination of the ongoing legacy of racism in medicine renders this trend concerning.
With COVID-19, efforts to prioritize people who suffer from systemic racism are often designed with the goal of righting some of these inequalities (e.g., [@url:https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-official-considering-giving-covid-19-vaccine-most-vulnerable-first-2020-10]), but particular attention to informed consent will be imperative in ensuring these trials are ethical given that the benefits and risks of emerging treatments are still poorly characterized.
Making a substantial effort to run inclusive clinical trials is also important because of the possibility that racism could impact how a patient responds to a treatment.
For example, the corticosteroid dexamethasone has been identified as a promising treatment for COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine release syndrome [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2021436], but, as discussed above, the mechanism of action of a corticosteroid is tied to the stress response.
A study from 2005 reported that Black asthma patients showed reduced responsiveness to dexamethasone in comparison to white patients and suggested Black patients might therefore require higher doses of the drug [@doi:10.1378/chest.127.2.571].
In the context of chronic stress caused by systemic racism, this result is not surprising: chronic stress is associated with dysregulated production of glucocorticoids [@doi:10.1146/annurev.physiol.67.040403.120816] and glucocorticoid receptor resistance [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1118355109].
However, it underscores the critical need for treatment guidelines to take into account differences in life experience, which would be facilitated by the recruitment of patients from a wide range of backgrounds.
Attention to the social aspects of clinical trial enrollment must therefore be an essential component of the medical research community's response to COVID-19.

### Approaching COVID-19 through the Lens of Embodiment
<!-- Add a paragraph here discussing the biological connection between these topics and make an argument for inflammation as etiologically linked to inequality.
- The existing COVID-19 research makes it clear that the pandemic intersects with a variety of social factors to create a syndemic.
- People who are more likely to be exposed to the virus are also more likely to lack adequate access to healthcare in the United States, among myriad other compounding factors.
