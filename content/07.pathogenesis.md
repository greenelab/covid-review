### Systems level approaches for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

Systems biology provides a cross-disciplinary analytical platform integrating the different omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics approaches), bioinformatics, and computational strategies. These cutting-edge research approaches have enormous potential to study the complexity of biological systems and human diseases [@doi:10.1016/j.gpb.2012.08.004]. Over the last decade, systems biology approaches are used vastly to study the pathogenesis of diverse types of life-threatening acute and chronic infectious diseases [@doi:10.1038/s41576-020-0212-5]. Omics-based studies also provided meaningful information regarding host immune responses and surrogate protein markers in several viral, bacterial and protozoan infections [@doi:10.1002/prca.201300074].


The complex pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not understood adequately yet. A prominent breakthrough in 2019-nCoV research is accomplished with the successful full-length genome sequencing of the pathogen [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3][@doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8][@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7]. Multiple research groups drafted the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from different clinical samples, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood, oral and anal swabs, and cultured isolates. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence homology with SARS-CoV (about 79%) and also to some extent with MERS-CoV (about 50%) [@doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8]. However, a higher level of similarity (about 90%) has been observed between SARS-CoV-2 and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) indicating its possible bat origin [@doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8][@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7].


The genome sequence of the pathogen subsequently allowed its phylogenetic characterization and prediction of its protein expression profile, which is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis and virulence of this novel viral infection.  In a recent computational bioinformatics study, Grifoni et al. predicted potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2, proving some clue regarding which part of the pathogen is recognized by human immune responses [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002]. Importantly, overactivation of T cells, caused by an increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, could be one of the major reasons behind the severe immune injury and fatality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [@doi:10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30076-X]. 


Availability of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 enhanced the possibilities for the subsequent proteome level studies that can provide further mechanistic insights into its complex pathogenesis. Of note, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, which plays an important role in the early steps of viral infection, is reported very recently [@doi:10.1126/science.abb2507].Even though any comprehensive proteomic analysis of the pathogen or the patients suffering from its infection has not been reported yet, one forthcoming study has demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics using human Cacoâ€“2 cells as an infection model [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-17218/v1]. The authors observed SARS-CoV-2 induced alterations in multiple vital physiological pathways, including translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism in the host cells.


There is a high level of sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and sera from convalescent SARS-CoV patients can effectively cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2-S-driven entry [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052]. Consequently, earlier proteome level studies on SARS-CoV can also provide some essential information regarding the new pathogen [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0407992101][@doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.074]. Considering the paucity of omics-level big data sets on for SARS-CoV-2 till now, the existing data hubs that contain adequate information for the other coronaviruses such as UniProt, NCBI Genome Database, The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), The Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) could be the useful resources for computational and bioinformatics research on SARS-CoV-2.
